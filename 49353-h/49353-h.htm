<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>The publication, in a permanent form, of the most valuable
sketches and speeches which have been produced in our
State will aid materially in laying the foundation for a distinctive
literature. In the beginning, character only is
essential; art is a development, and will assume its comely
form in due season if it springs from virtue. The undeserving
are the fearful and the unbelieving, and these are they
who are morbidly anxious to graft borrowed ideals of literary
culture upon the native stock.</p>

<p>The people are entitled to the sources of history (the
knowledge of which, in this State, is confined to a very few),
because from among the people must always arise the man
who breaks the monopoly which sequesters the facts of public
interest for private interpretation.</p>

<p>Failure in some writers to give the sources of information
and of ideas, and to give credit or quote where these are
already well expressed, has caused much confusion in the
historical data of this State. This practice is fatal to any
considerable literary reputation and an unwitting confession
of incapacity.</p>

<p>The educational value of these sketches and speeches, and
of such as may be published at a later period, is probably
what will chiefly recommend this undertaking to the consideration
of the public. A good course of home reading
about worthy men close enough to the reader to stimulate
his interest can hardly be overvalued, and it is the best substitute
for the training of the schools as well as a powerful
assistant in such training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remarked that some of the best sketches of our
distinguished dead have been written to be spoken; but they
are none the less effectual among North Carolinians, who
have generally been hearers rather than readers: those, therefore,
who have desired their attention have cultivated oratory.
The style of the effective writer, however, is more condensed
than that of the orator&mdash;freer from passion and local prejudice
and fitter to paint for posterity pictures of the past.</p>

<p>To the ladies of the memorial associations of North Carolina,
and to those who have generously responded to the
honor of their calls, our people are indebted for the collection,
in the form of addresses, and the consequent preservation
of some valuable historical matter. This is especially
true of the Ladies' Memorial Association of Raleigh, as the
sketches of Grimes, Ramseur, Pender, and Hill, here published,
will attest.</p>

<p>No less deserving are those who of their own accord, or
at the request of others, have prepared sketches of such as
have done deeds worthy of remembrance. Born of some
patriotic North Carolina woman, a man will arise who will
use the stubborn facts so preserved to bruise the serpent-head
of false history.</p>

<p>It will not be understood, of course, that an attempt is
made in this volume to publish the lives of all distinguished
North Carolinians&mdash;there are others, perhaps, as worthy as
any which here appear; and should this book be approved
and sufficiently sustained by reading people, another volume
may be added at some future time.</p>

<p>My main object will be attained if interest in those who
have done something worthy of remembrance is stimulated.</p>

<p>Much of what is called biography and history is a tiresome
chronicle of the successive advancement in office of some
who have advanced little in better things. Service, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
office, is the inspired test of greatness. He who would be
greatest among you must be the servant of all.</p>

<p>In this materialistic age it is nothing strange that some
North Carolina writers have praised such as have done well
mainly for themselves; and while I do not remember that, in
the collection here published, place and station are set forth as
an end rather than a means to good, yet here, as elsewhere
and everywhere, the thoughtful reader will be on his guard
against any squint in favor of false ideals.</p>

<p>As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses by the art of
counterfeiting the symbols of Heaven's appointment, a devilish
power, so this age suffers much from spurious greatness,
persistently advertised, as bearing the image and superscription
of virtue.</p>

<p>Human limitation is such that a character is sometimes
worthy of study which only effectually illustrates one great
virtue growing among defects; and human nature, unless
morbid, instead of being contaminated, will be encouraged
that weakness can deserve fame. The defects which criticism
may discover in any character here portrayed may be used,
under intelligent guidance, to gain the sympathy of the young
rather than mar their ideals&mdash;which must be composite pictures
of the virtues of many, or else imaged on the soul by
contemplation of the life and work of One who was the
Servant of all.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>This book is written of North Carolinians by North Carolinians.
Many of the writers are no less distinguished than
their subjects, and these together give it local color, distinctiveness,
and personality which ought to make it interesting
to ourselves and valuable to those who seek to know us
through intrinsic evidence.</p>

<p>Wherever practicable the subjects are allowed also to speak
for themselves. "Biography is the only true history,"
says Carlyle. The history of North Carolina has not yet
been written, and never will be, until each pioneer investigator
confines himself to a short period&mdash;say a decade. Then,
eventually, perhaps, some genius for generalization and condensation
will arise and in a single life-time combine the
whole into one work. Meanwhile this generation may bind
up and preserve the material.</p>

<p>There is not sufficient political homogeneity among North
Carolinians at this time to enable us to endorse with unanimity
the true theory of our history for the past seventy years&mdash;especially
in our relation to the General Government.</p>

<p>This generation, too, is inundated with cheap and often
insidiously false sectional literature from the North.</p>

<p>Such literature is gradually glozing over and reconciling
our people to the sinister changes which are being subtly
wrought in American institutions.</p>

<p>The innovators can now persuade the misinformed and
careless that just criticism of themselves and their cupidity,
and just defense of the principles and motives which actuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
us in the late war between the States, is rank treason against
the United States Government.</p>

<p>To publish what our sages and warriors have taught and
fought for rises, therefore, to the dignity of a duty, as tending
to correct erroneous impressions common among us and
still more common among others, and as giving a particular
account rendered by many witnesses, of men and times to be
remembered by posterity, rightly or wrongly, forever.</p>

<p>This introduction is intended to present also a bird's-eye
view of the field in which were cast the lives and labors of the
subjects of this book. Incidentally, too, I indicate a theory
of Southern history which, if not obvious enough upon its
bare statement, or from the facts here briefly set forth, will
one day be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the seeker
after truth. It involves an analysis of the character, influence,
and interests of the North acting on the South.</p>

<p>The inoculation of New England semi-foreign views of
the Federal Constitution (for half New England is foreign
born) goes on apace. With conceit, born of provincialism,
these people have magnified their Mayflower scrap of local
history into national importance; they have dinned it with
such Codrus-like persistency into our ears that the average
North Carolinian knows their story better than he does that of
the settlement of Roanoke Island. We read their books,
papers, and periodicals, though many reflect upon us, and
nearly all are unfair to us; but they do not read ours. It
would be a surprise to the publishers if one hundred copies
of this book should be sold north of Mason and Dixon's line&mdash;a
line which still exists against our literature, our ideas, and
our construction of fundamental law. Most probably not
one of their monthlies would publish what I am now writing.</p>

<p>The most un-American section of the Union is New England.
Bounded on the west and north by British Canada and
on the east by the Atlantic ocean (which may be said now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
belong also to Great Britain), it is the hotbed of British ideas
of government and society; and, in the event of a third war
with the "mother country" (as it still affectionately terms
the nation whose government has always been the enemy of
our liberty, growth, and progress) it may be a hotbed for a
hundred times more traitors than it had in the War of 1812.
Like our great cities, this section is a danger-spot in the Union.</p>

<p>Many of its political and social leaders vie with those of
New York in rushing over to England and Germany to get
the foreign construction of our Federal Constitution, and foreign
consent to proposed financial legislation by Congress,
and foreign sanction of the orders, social preferences and privileges,
and marriages of our "corner"-made aristocracy.</p>

<p>These leaders, too, are less and less the owners of the wealth
they handle, and are becoming more and more the mere agents
of English capitalists and the dupes and tools of foreign marriage-brokers.
About three thousand million dollars of British
capital is said to be invested in a section of the Union.
This copartnership of foreign and domestic wealth gives to
Great Britain a voice in our government&mdash;a representation in
Congress from whole groups of States. How many Northeastern
Senators and Representatives have differed in late
years from British views of what our financial policy should
be? Foreign and domestic monopolists and bondholders have
the same interests, the same social sympathies and affinities,
a common cause, the same victims and enemies, the same want
of confidence in popular government; therefore, what doth
hinder them from forming a treasonable alliance, offensive
and defensive, against the people? They have already formed
it: the money-kings in all nations, in control of all kings and
governments, have an understanding with one another, and,
by concentration, they can easily crush any movement, for
amelioration, among the people of any one nation at a time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
There is a brotherhood, too, of incorporated rate, fare, and tax
collectors as well as of bondholders. United they stand.</p>

<p>The Hamiltonian theory of government has been in adoption,
and the Hamiltonian school of politicians has been in
control of the Union for nearly forty years, and they may
now be judged by their fruits: they have given us a more corruptly
administered government than that our fathers rebelled
against in 1775; and they are fulfilling with startling fidelity
and rapidity all the prophecies which Henry, Jefferson,
Macon, and Randolph made about them.</p>

<p>It is a knowledge of these things which has organized a
great rebellion in the United States, especially among those
who live outside the great cities and homes of monopoly&mdash;a
rebellion which has begun to control political parties, and
which, in the last general election, mustered nearly six and
a half million voters&mdash;voters who were hurled, for once,
against the great international brotherhood of plunderers by
legislation. Some, however, who were in it are not of it;
these, when they comprehend it, will become offended and
walk no more with it. A new declaration of independence
is being formulated to voice its spirit, and it awaits its Jefferson,
if, indeed, as some believe, he has not already come in
the person of Bryan, a Western man descended from Southern
ancestors, and seeming to have at heart the interests of
all sections.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact, in this connection, that from two-thirds
to three-fourths of the foreign voters in the Union
marched under the allied leadership of foreign and domestic
monopoly and ill-gotten wealth. Two-thirds, at least, of the
native-born white voters were in this great rebellion, and the
life and soul of it. The negro voted almost solidly with the
foreigners and with his new masters, for he will have masters
of some kind yet for many years. I note the status and attitude
of the negro seriously (and let him that readeth understand),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for if this ever-deepening conflict comes to bullets,
those who now tell the old Federal soldier to vote as he shot,
will tell the negro to shoot as he voted; and he will so shoot.
The negro vote, under the easy control of a sectional faction
of political manipulators, is as dangerous a menace to our institutions
as our foreign population indoctrinated with European
medievalism&mdash;kingcraft and priestcraft.</p>

<p>Much, if not most, of our foreign immigration now comes
from cities, and pours itself into the already corrupted life of
our own great cities. ("Syrian Orontes pours its filth into
The Tiber."&mdash;<i>Juv.</i>) It does not buy land, it sells votes; it
specifically performs the political contracts of its priests; it
buys and sells political jobs; it officers ward politics. It is
one of the arms&mdash;and the negro is the other&mdash;by which greed
and monopoly, the twin devils which dance attendance upon
national decline, are consolidating our government.</p>

<p>No great city has ever been fit for self-government and
civil liberty. From Babylon to Nineveh, from Nineveh to
Carthage, from Carthage to Rome, from Rome to Venice,
and from Venice to New York and Chicago (neither of which
can elect an honest board of aldermen), it is the same old
story of avarice which finally overreaches itself. This is the
sin which, when finished, brings forth the death of nations.</p>

<p>In vain did Virgil and Horace sing their deathless melodies
of country homes to a people whose blood was already poisoned
with the lust for gain and fevered with the excitement
of artificial life.</p>

<p>The South, the rural South, in spite of many shortcomings,
is the great conservator of our institutions. It is the distinctively
American section of the Union, jealous of all foreign
domination or interference, and stands firm in the
patriot's faith that we as a nation can work out our own salvation
without the aid of European capital or distinctively
European ideas of finance, government or society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Though contaminated by modern machine politics, and
much hampered by the race question, the South still clings
to local self-government and to the dignity of Statehood as
the only sure foundation for civil liberty and perpetual Union.
Long taxed unfairly, by the subtle operation of the Federal
tariff and internal revenue and currency laws, out of money
which has long enriched another section, in the shape of
pensions, internal improvements, and "protection to home industries,"
the South is still the section most loyal to constitutional
government, having infinitely more genuine affection
for it than the pension-pampered patriotism of such as make
merchandise out of "saving the Union."</p>

<p>These considerations are sufficient to inspire in us an effort
to write our own histories, expound to our children the principles
of fundamental law, and teach them the safeguards of
our institutions. The collection and arrangement of the following
sketches, with a few crude suggestions of my own, is
what I have contributed towards this end.</p>

<p>Except in so far as "history is philosophy teaching by
examples," I take little pleasure in it, and should be at no
pains to preserve or popularize it. But seeing, as I think
I see, the drift and tendencies of these times, and believing
that a correct and widespread understanding of the lessons
of recent events is the first postulate in determining the
remedy for existing and prospective evils, I take an abiding
interest in every earnest endeavor to marshal the facts and
discover the theories which will explain them&mdash;for facts without
theories are dead. The field of investigation is white
unto harvest, but the laborers for love are few&mdash;the hirelings
are many.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the necessity of our reading and
writing our own histories, I will undertake to show the main
cause of the war between the States, indicating as I go along
some of the errors called history, which are circulated and
taught to the prejudice of the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Northern historians make the negro and the interest of
their people in his welfare the underlying cause of the agitation
which resulted in the war between the States. Some of
them would have us believe that the Federal soldiers, a generation
ago, fired with the love of liberty and humanity, came
South on a great missionary tour to strike the fetters from the
limbs of four million slaves. About fifty per cent. of these
missionaries were foreigners, or foreign born, having but
crude ideas of the nature of our government; many thousands
of them could not even speak our language; some were Hessians,
imported from foreign tyrannies expressly for the purpose
of war. Many tens of thousands came for money, and
hundreds of thousands were compelled to come by law. Not
ten per cent. came to free the negro. Those acquainted with
the esteem in which he is held at the North have never been
deceived by this <em>missionary</em> theory of his emancipation. Listen
to the words of De Tocqueville, written about 1835. This
Frenchman certainly cannot be accused of having been biased
against the Northern States. He says: "Whosoever has
inhabited the United States must have perceived, that in those
parts of the Union in which the negroes are no longer slaves,
they have in nowise drawn nearer to the whites. On the
contrary, the prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in
the States which have abolished slavery than in those where
it still exists; and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those
States where servitude has never been known. * * * *</p>

<p>"The electoral franchise has been conferred upon the
negroes in almost all the States in which slavery has been
abolished; but, if they come forward to vote, their lives are
in danger. If oppressed, they may bring an action at law,
but they will find none but whites amongst their judges; and,
although they may legally serve as jurors, prejudice repulses
them from that office. The same schools do not receive the
child of the black and of the European. In the theatres gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cannot procure a seat for the servile race beside their former
masters; in the hospitals they lie apart; and, although they are
allowed to invoke the same Divinity as the whites, it must be
at a different altar and in their own churches, with their own
clergy. The gates of Heaven are not closed against these unhappy
beings; but their inferiority is continued to the very
confines of the other world; when the negro is defunct his
bones are cast aside, and the distinction of condition prevails
even in the equality of death. The negro is free, but he can
share neither the rights, nor the pleasures, nor the labor, nor
the afflictions, nor the tomb of him whose equal he has been
declared to be; and he cannot meet him upon fair terms in
life or in death."&mdash;<cite>Democracy in America</cite>, page 339.</p>

<p>The negro's freedom was accidental and merely incidental
to the main purpose of the war. When the alternative was
secession or war, the sentiment of the most rabid abolitionists
was voiced by Horace Greeley, who was willing that the
"erring sisters depart in peace." Many abolitionists were sincere,
though fanatical, and they had too often invoked the
doctrine of secession, for the North, to consistently object
when the South invoked it. Abraham Lincoln (a shrewd,
practical Western countryman, put into his high office to hold
the agricultural West against the agricultural South) put the
war exclusively upon the ground of saving the Union. He
would save the Union, he said, whether it enslaved the negro
or freed him. In his inaugural address, March, 1861, he
said: "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere
with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.
I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no
inclination to do so." Eight days before, Sumner, the abolition
leader, had said in Congress: "I take this occasion to
declare most explicitly that I do not think Congress has any
right to interfere with slavery in a State." Neither Lincoln
nor Sumner, if they are to be credited with any sincerity, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stumbled upon the policy of freeing the negro; and, if they
had, it would have been very impolitic to have then disclosed
it, for all the border States would then have joined the South.</p>

<p>The negro was freed as a means to an end. The emancipation
proclamation was a "war measure," and, as such, a
master-stroke, for it took two hundred and fifty thousand
laborers out of the South and put muskets into the hands of
nearly two hundred thousand colored troops. This was the
difference between success and failure, and was the turning
point in the war, as was admitted by Lincoln in his message
to Congress, in which he said: * * * * "and for a long
time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed
without resorting to it [the policy of emancipation] as a military
measure." The negro incidentally caused the defeat of
the South; and he was also incidentally a cause of the war,
but not the causing cause&mdash;<em>that lies deeper, and must be
rightly understood at the peril of the nation</em>.</p>

<p>The war was about taxation&mdash;the usual cause of revolution.
A century ago it was taxation without representation; a generation
ago it was unequal, discriminating, sectional, and class
taxation. Out of this still grows the political strife whose
quadrennial flood rises higher and higher at each election:
income taxes successfully resisted by the rich; rate, fare, and
tariff taxes unsuccessfully resisted by the poor&mdash;these are the
fruitful causes of war&mdash;fought with ballots first, and finally,
if no remedy can be found, with bullets.</p>

<p>The truth must be told even if it diminishes the glory of
those who "saved the Union"&mdash;and made money by it. The
blood of the last generation was not shed in vain, if we, with
the advantages we enjoy, learn and teach the lessons which
all posterity will demand of us&mdash;both for the sake of those
who perished and of those who may perish if we suffer them
to believe a lie. Forewarned is forearmed.</p>

<p>Under our Federal revenue laws, those who have produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the export crops (in quantities sufficient to invite the exploits
of political manufacturing and trade combinations) have long
paid far more than their share of the expenses of government.
They were not allowed to buy in the open market, where they
sold their crops, but in the restricted "home market," at
prices not fixed by open competition. But the said combinations
bought these crops in a free market and sold their own
products in a protected market. So they got more benefit
than the government: first, in being relieved from Federal
taxes, which the producers of the export crops paid; second,
in incidental, then in avowed, protection; third, in the system
of internal improvements which they were obliged to invent
to dispose of the surplus revenues raised as an incident
to giving them "protection"; and these "improvements"
usually improved one section and impoverished the other.</p>

<p>So, early in the game, we find one <em>class</em>, the political combinations
of manufacturers, growing rich, and another class,
the ill-combined agriculturalists, growing correspondingly
poor. Prior to 1860, even more than now, relatively,
cotton was the great export crop of America, and was also
the principal money crop of a section; so the tax suffered on
account of it was sectional. Being also manufactured in a
section, the benefits enjoyed on account of it were sectional.
So we have the <em>sections</em>, as well as the classes, antagonistic,
and made so by the operation of a Federal revenue law&mdash;one
section growing richer and the other growing correspondingly
poorer in the sight of all men.</p>

<p>Political parties aligned according to "geographical discriminations"
(against which Washington warned but did not
provide), arose and cursed each other, from 1816&mdash;the date
of the first distinctively protective tariff (which, as increased
in 1828 and 1830, provoked South Carolina's first acts of
secession)&mdash;to 1861, the date of the Morrill tariff, with sixty
per cent. protection in it, which, passed March 2d, and flaunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the face of the seven already seceded States, rendered reconciliation
impossible. The Confederate Constitution declaring
in its very first article against even incidental protection,
conveyed no hint to the wilfully blind revenue-hunters that
the most oppressed of the agricultural States had formed their
combination to resist the plunder of Federal tariff, as well as
other sectional aggressions.</p>

<p>Lincoln's policy of reenforcing Federal forts in the South
(the immediate cause of the war) was bottomed on a purpose
to collect this odious tax (the tariff of 1861), a policy which
Alexander H. Stephens says was not determined upon until
the "seven war Governors" (from the seven most protected
States) offered to furnish the troops requisite to subdue the
States then seceded. The border States had decided for the
Union before Lincoln's acts of aggression; and he, therefore,
though erroneously, supposed that they all would either aid
him or remain neutral until he could "strengthen the Government"
by the conquest of the cotton States.</p>

<p>By means of the tariff the cotton crop had been made the
scapegoat upon which, in relief of wealth and monopoly, was
piled the huge iniquity of Federal taxes; but more than that,
and worse than that, the tariff was the engine by which the
political combination of spinners and shippers forced down the
price of that crop.</p>

<p>As far back as 1791, Hamilton and those in charge of the
revenue department of the General Government (a certain
school of politicians has always had a Judas-like fondness for
carrying the bag), finding the express powers under the Constitution
too weak for the purposes of exploit, began to lay
the foundation for a new government by implied powers under
court construction; by means of which they and "their successors
in office" have slowly but steadily amended the Constitution,
consolidated our Federation, and undermined the
rights of the States. While they were experimenting to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which States it was most advantageous to form into a
copartnership with the General Government, they invented
an unequal and discriminating tax on carriages, which fell
heaviest on New Jersey, where they were principally manufactured.
Seeing the burden of half a dozen States fall on
one, North Carolina and some others denounced it as infamous
and unconstitutional.</p>

<p>After a few more such experiments, in which it was learned
effectually that the purely agricultural States could not be
seduced into taking advantage of their sisters, the manipulators
of the Treasury induced the General Government to coquet
with the States which were more or less under the control
of the political combinations of merchants, manufacturers,
bankers, and speculators; and with more success.</p>

<p>A copartnership was perfected between the General Government
and the protected States by the tariff of 1816; and
the mutual considerations passed were first named "incidental
benefit" for one party to the contract and "liberal construction"
of implied powers for the other. Angry protests and
sectional incriminations and recriminations followed, and
awakened Jefferson, like "an alarm-bell at night," out of the
sleep of old age. The "peculiar institution" of one section
gave the other a terrible advantage, which it was quick to see
and to seize; and it was used remorselessly. Greed, suddenly
joining philanthropy, religion, and fanaticism, organized and
led a crusade against <em>African</em> slavery. The agitation about
the negro, as a counter-irritant to distract attention from the
injustice of Federal revenue laws, was more than a success: for
the shallow politicians of both sections forgot the real issue;
but the beneficiaries never lost sight of it. I will use a
homely illustration: A and B are doing business on opposite
sides of a street; B begins to undersell A; A becomes
angry, but cannot afford to tell his customers the cause; he
hears that B once cheated a negro out of a mule; he makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that charge; they fight; the court record of the trial shows
that the fight was about the negro and the mule; but there
is not a business man on the street who does not know that
the record speaks a lie.</p>

<p>The first speech in this book opens with old Nat. Macon
lecturing (in 1820) a Representative from Pennsylvania, the
most protected State, for expressing a desire to see the Union
dissolved rather than that slavery should be extended beyond
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Slavery, itself, while for several generations usually beneficial
to the negro, was, doubtless, in many respects injurious
to his masters. It made us provincial, of necessity, sensitive
and intolerant of criticism, easily susceptible of misrepresentation,
and cut us off from the sympathy of some who else
had been our friends. It cramped thought, invention, progress,
poetry, and literature. It enabled monopoly to divide
and conquer the tillers of the soil. It tended to create caste
and it <em>degraded manual labor</em>&mdash;as necessary as death after
sin and decreed in the same Divine judgment. Skilled manual
labor gutted the Confederacy by driving war-ships up its
rivers: and the felt want of it, in late years, has established
a great industrial institution at our State capital, the mother
of many others, and destined to revolutionize education among
us.</p>

<p>"Protection" and discrimination in the operation of the
Federal revenue laws, though still potent for evil, will probably
never again be the principal, causing cause of another
revolution unto blood; because from three to ten per cent. of
our Southern population will henceforward be directly benefited
by such laws, and their interests will soften the sectional
aspect of the tax. But the unequal and sectional operation of
the currency laws, alienating the West as well as the South;
the heaping up of nearly all the wealth of the country into one
section, and most of it in a few great cities of that section;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the plunder of agriculture by legislation and by the unchecked
conspiracy of capital; the monopoly of the carrying trade by
the wealth of the cities; the growing distrust between the
urban and rural populations; the sullen and fickle temper of
our foreign elements&mdash;the nucleus, perhaps, of a future Prætorian
Guard; the mutterings against the now "vested right"
of protected labor to be fed or assisted by the government&mdash;and
capital hides behind such labor; machine politics and
party spirit; the prostitution of the electoral system by the
national nominating mob system, which treats sovereign States
as the provinces of a party; the fine Italian hand of a certain
religio-political corporation in getting offices and holding the
balance of power between the factions contending for public
plunder; the growing intimacy of sectional wealth with
foreign governments and aristocracies&mdash;these are the dangers
which together threaten a perpetual Union of the States and
the liberties of the people.</p>

<p>Before 1860, Macaulay prophesied that our government
would go to pieces over a presidential election. In the face
of these dangers, it is well for us to consider and carefully
teach our children the causes which have worked our injury
in the past, in order that we and they may be the better able
to recognize and grapple them when they reappear, under
changed names or in the shape of new laws.</p>

<p>But a tariff tax as a causing cause of the late war shall not
rest upon the foregoing testimony alone. "Let the South
go," exclaimed Abraham Lincoln, in 1861, "where then shall
we get our revenues?" This man was noted for hitting the
bull's-eye, and Divine Inspiration had forestalled him with the
prophecy that the love of revenue was the root of all evil.</p>

<p>Thomas H. Benton is a witness who will be heard. In a
speech in the Senate, in 1828, he shows how the tariff (which,
except for about twelve years, had been mainly levied for
revenue) had plundered the South. He said: "I feel for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sad changes which have taken place in the South during the
last fifty years. Before the Revolution it was the seat of
wealth as well as hospitality. Money, and all it commanded,
abounded there. But how is it now? All this is reversed.
Wealth has fled from the South, and settled in the regions
north of the Potomac; and this in the face of the fact that
the South, in four staples alone, has exported produce since
the Revolution to the value of eight hundred millions of dollars;
and the North has exported comparatively nothing.
Such an export would indicate unparalleled wealth, but what
is the fact? In the place of wealth a universal pressure for
money is felt&mdash;not enough for current expenses&mdash;the price
of property all down&mdash;the country drooping and languishing&mdash;towns
and cities decaying&mdash;and the frugal habits of the
people pushed to the verge of universal self-denial for the
preservation of their family estates. Such a result is a strange
and wonderful phenomenon. It calls upon statesmen to inquire
into the cause.</p>

<p>"Under Federal legislation the exports of the South have
been the basis of the Federal revenue. * * * * Virginia,
the two Carolinas, and Georgia may be said to defray three-fourths
of the annual expense of supporting the Federal Government;
and of this great sum, annually furnished by them,
nothing, or next to nothing, is returned to them in the shape
of government expenditure. That expenditure flows in an
opposite direction&mdash;it flows northwardly, in one uniform, uninterrupted,
and perennial stream. This is the reason why
wealth disappears from the South and rises up in the North.
Federal legislation does all this. It does it by the simple
process of eternally taking from the South and returning nothing
to it. If it returned to the South the whole or even a
good part of what it exacted the four States south of the
Potomac might stand the action of the system, but the South
must be exhausted of its money and its property by a course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of legislation which is forever taking away and never returning
anything. Every new tariff increases the force of this
action. No tariff has ever yet included Virginia, the two
Carolinas, and Georgia, except to increase the burdens imposed
by them."&mdash;Benton's <cite>Thirty Years View</cite>, Vol. I, p.
98, quoted by Raphael Semmes in his <cite>Memoirs of Service
Afloat</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1860 we find the South still furnished many millions
more than two-thirds of the export crops, besides fifty millions
to the North. In Colonial and Revolutionary times the South
was the richest section, and so acknowledged to be in the Constitutional
Convention of 1787.</p>

<p>No wonder that the South always insisted that the Federation
was a limited partnership; and no wonder that her rapacious
partners insisted on a government of unlimited powers,
when they employed such powers for unequal taxation,
sectional expenditures, and unlimited "protection." Those
who have clamored most persistently for a "strong government"
have never scrupled to sap its strength for purposes
of private emolument. Those who have panted most for a
consolidated republic have now fully disclosed their purpose
of sequestering its assets. They have not consolidated the
patriotism of the republic, but they have drawn a line of division
from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes&mdash;a division of interests,
division of sentiment, division of population, division
of history, and a division of churches. Who can measure
the hypocrisy of those writers and politicians who teach
the people that the way to make the government strong is
to give to one section "implied powers" to plunder the other?
Having gotten their wealth by the craft of booming nationalism
and centralization, they now perceive that in order to keep
it they must hold themselves ready to "hedge" with the
doctrine of States' rights and reserved powers. So, while college
professors are confusing the mind of youth about "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
two opposing theories of government," the facts of opposing
interests are jarring the foundations of society and wrenching
the fetters which bind the States in a "more perfect
Union."</p>

<p>Robert Toombs said, in a speech before the Georgia Legislature,
in November, 1860: "The instant the Government
was organized, at the very first Congress, the Northern States
evinced a general desire and purpose to use it for their own
benefit, and to pervert its powers for sectional advantage, and
they have steadily pursued that policy to this day. They demanded
a monopoly of the business of ship-building, and got
a prohibition against the sale of foreign ships to citizens of
the United States, which exists to this day. They demanded
a monopoly of the coasting trade, in order to get higher
freights than they could get in open competition with the
carriers of the world. Congress gave it to them, and they
yet hold this monopoly. * * * These same shipping interests,
with cormorant rapacity, have steadily burrowed their
way through your legislative halls, until they have saddled the
agricultural classes with a large portion of the legitimate expenses
of their own business. We pay a million dollars per
annum for the lights which guide them in and out of your
ports. We have built, and keep up, at the cost of at least another
million a year, hospitals for their sick and disabled seamen,
when they wear them out and cast them ashore. We pay
half a million to support and bring home those they cast
away in foreign lands. They demand, and have received,
millions of the public money to increase the safety of harbors
and lessen the danger of navigating our rivers; all of
which expenses legitimately fall upon their business, and
should come out of their own pockets, instead of a common
treasury.</p>

<p>"Even the fishermen of Massachusetts and New England
demand and receive from the public treasury about half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
million dollars per annum as a pure bounty in their business of
catching codfish. The North, at the very first Congress, demanded
and received bounties, under the name of protection,
for every trade, craft and calling which its people pursue, and
there is not an artisan in brass, or iron, or wood, or weaver
or spinner in wool or cotton, or calico-maker, or iron-master,
or a coal-owner, in all the Northern or Middle States, who
has not received what he calls the protection of his government
on his industry to the extent of from fifteen to two hundred
per cent. from the year 1791 to this day. They will
not strike a blow or stretch a muscle without bounties from
the government. No wonder they cry aloud for the glorious
Union. They have the same reason for praising it that the
craftsmen of Ephesus had for shouting 'Great is Diana of the
Ephesians!' By it they get their wealth, by it they levy
tribute on honest labor."</p>

<p>The future historian will devote a long chapter to show
how the slavery agitation "ebbed and flowed with the sinking
and the swelling" in the voices of protest from the much-plundered
South; voices which were keyed to the pitch of
secession and revolution against the tariff of 1828, and which
again, in 1861, shouted in warlike defiance until they were
hushed in blood. That chapter will point also in shame to the
dark record which shows that on March 2, 1861, after seven
States had seceded and their Representatives in Congress had
withdrawn, and while four other States were preparing to secede
if found necessary, greed thrust its "lewd snout" into
the purity of that chastening hour when many thousand patriots
still prayed that the awful catastrophe might be averted,
and got by force a tariff with sixty per cent. protection in it!
Hear the effect of that measure from the lips of a North Carolinian,
General Clingman, who was lingering in the Senate
in the hope of reconciliation: "But, Mr. President, there
is another difficulty in the way, and we might as well talk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
this frankly. I know it is present to the minds of Senators
on the other side, and they must see the difficulty. The honorable
Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Simmons) particularly,
who engineered the tariff bill through, of course sees the
difficulty. * * * The revenues under that tariff bill cannot
be collected anywhere, I think, if the declarations which
gentlemen make are to be acted out. If they are to hold that
all the Confederate States are in the Union, and that you are
to have no custom-houses, on the line between them and the
other States, what will be the result? Goods will come into
New Orleans, Charleston, Mobile, and other places; they will
come in paying a low tariff, and merchants from Tennessee,
Kentucky, Illinois, and Ohio, if they choose to go down there
and buy goods, will take them home and pay no duties. No
man from the Northwest will go to New York and pay a duty
of fifty per cent. on goods that he can get at a fifteen or
twenty per cent. duty at New Orleans. That will be the
course of trade, of course. Senators must see that you cannot
have two tariffs, one high and one low, in operation in the
country at once, with any effect produced by the high tariff.
If you go to a man and say: 'You may pay me a high price
or a low price for an article,' you will never get the high
price. When, therefore, you attempt to carry out the new
tariff, which contains rates, I think, of fifty per cent., and
some of one hundred per cent., and some even above one hundred
per cent., you cannot collect those rates at Boston and
New York and Philadelphia, while the men who want to consume
the goods can get them by paying a duty of one-third
as much. That is impossible. I presume the Senator from
Rhode Island, and those who acted with him, did not intend
the tariff, which has lately passed, to be a mere farce, a mere
thing on paper, not to be acted out. Of course they mean to
get duties under it some way or other. If you do not mean
to have your line of custom-houses along the border of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Confederate States you must expect to stop importations
there."&mdash;<cite>Speeches and Writings of T. L. Clingman</cite>, pp. 61,
62: extract from speech delivered in United States Senate,
March 19, 1861.</p>

<p>Yes, and it was the armed attempt to "stop importations
there" that brought on the war!</p>

<p>Why it was that the bombardment, on April 12, 1861, of
a Federal <em>fort</em> about to be reenforced "fired the Northern
heart" more than the bombardment, on January 9, 1861, of
a Federal <em>war-ship</em> attempting to carry reinforcements to that
fort, the Northern historians, like the Pharisees, "cannot
tell." And they never tell that between the two bombardments
sectional monopoly had brooded, and on March 2d
hatched a cockatrice egg of sectional advantage; that its beneficiaries
had had opportunity to touch noses with the "seven
war Governors" and that the inspiration of such a touch accounts
for the zeal with which they urged the President to
war, when twenty-one States were trying to effect peace; that
between the 15th and the 28th of March these Governors had
a secret conference with the President in Washington, in which
they pledged their States to support him in "collecting the
revenues of the Government"; and that, thus assured, he had,
to the astonishment of the South and most of his own constituents,
suddenly sent the invading expedition to reenforce
Fort Sumter! Did this same influence persuade Lincoln to
refuse to allow the Supreme Court or even Congress to pass
upon the much-mooted constitutional question of the right to
secede? Of course it was familiar learning to him that all
the States, especially the Northeastern, had from time to time
asserted, acted on, or acquiesced in this right. Did the tariff
Governors induce this man, reputed to be tender-hearted, to
decide, on his own responsibility, a question of law which
forced the issue of blood at a cost of a million lives, and a
sinister change in the character and conduct of our government?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Did they seduce him into fitting out an armament to
collect the revenues at Charleston, and, at the same time, leave
open for construction and equivocation his doubtful and inconsistent
expressions about enforcing the Federal laws and
Supreme Court decisions giving protection to Southern property
in slaves? Why was it that, in this awful crisis, he refused
to call Congress together until he had precipitated war
by his invasion and his call for volunteers, unless it was because
his extra-constitutional advisers feared to trust a body
which passed a conciliatory resolution even after battles had
been fought and blood had been shed? Why was it that by
the very terms of his war proclamation he put off the assembling
of Congress for two months and nineteen days after he
had declared war, unless it was because he was willing to forestall
its action, and preferred to rely on the conspiring war
Governors and their protected constituents to sustain him,
rather than on his constitutional advisers and the Representatives
of the people? Monopoly could not then trust the Supreme
Court, for the Dred Scott decision showed that it might
again adhere to the original view of the Constitution; and its
best members were zealous to effect compromise and peace.
That Lincoln and his Cabinet were against the policy of coercion,
until somebody influenced them, has been confessed
by at least one of its members.</p>

<p>A valuable side-light on the mainsprings of Lincoln's
policy is furnished by Dr. R. L. Dabney. He says that while
Virginia, through her convention, sitting in April, 1861, was
making a last effort to save the Union, Seward sent a confidential
messenger, Allen B. McGruder, to Richmond, to urge
that a representative be sent to Washington in all haste.
McGruder stated that he was authorized by Seward to say that
Fort Sumter would be evacuated on Friday of the ensuing
week and that the <i>Pawnee</i> would sail on the following Monday
for Charleston to effect the evacuation. Colonel Baldwin, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
original Union man, was fixed upon as the best representative
of the peace sentiment. "He and McGruder," continues
Dabney, "set out on the night following and arrived in
Washington early the next morning. Immediately after
breakfast they drove to Mr. Seward's, when the latter took
charge of Mr. Baldwin, and the two went directly to the
White House, where they arrived about nine o'clock. They
found Mr. Lincoln engaged, but, upon Mr. Seward's whispering
in his ear, he excused himself and conducted Mr. Seward
and Colonel Baldwin into a sleeping apartment and locked
the door.</p>

<p>"After the usual formalities, Colonel Baldwin presented
his credentials. After Lincoln had read the credentials, Colonel
Baldwin proceeded to state to him what was the opinion
of the great body of Virginians, both in the convention
and out of it. This opinion was as follows, to wit: 'That
although opposed to a Presidential election upon a sectional
free-soil platform, which they deplored as most dangerous and
unwise, Virginia did not approve of making that, evil as it
was, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus belli</i>, or a ground for disrupting the Union.
That much as Virginia disapproved of it, if Mr. Lincoln would
only adhere faithfully to the Constitution and the laws, she
would support him just as faithfully as though he was the
man of her choice, and would wield her whole moral force
to keep the border States in the Union, and to bring back the
seven seceded States; but that, while much difference of opinion
existed on the question whether the right of secession was
a constitutional one, all Virginians were unanimous in believing
that no right existed in the Federal Government to coerce
a state by force of arms.' To this Mr. Lincoln replied:
'You are too late, sir; <em>too late</em>!' Colonel Baldwin understood
this as a clear intimation that the policy of coercion had
just been determined upon, and, as he discovered, "<em>within
four days</em>." Impressed with the deep solemnity of the occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Colonel Baldwin made a final appeal, asking, among
other things, that all questions at issue should be left for adjudication
by the constitutional tribunals. Lincoln asked a few
questions, the last of which was, "What will become of my
tariff?" He put this question with such force of emphasis
as clearly indicated that this consideration should decide the
whole matter.</p>

<p>The peace ambassadors sent to Washington by the Virginia
convention immediately upon Baldwin's return found the
same difficulty. "They saw Mr. Lincoln. The tariff was
still the burden of his complaint. They left the next day;
and the same train which carried them to Virginia carried
Lincoln's proclamation also for the seventy-five thousand
troops." See <cite>North Carolina in the War Between the States</cite>,
by Sloan, pp. 27, 28, 29, 30, quoting R. L. Dabney, in the
<cite>Southern Historical Papers</cite>.</p>

<p>There was a subtle influence at Washington strong enough
to veer Lincoln round from Seward, whose constituents
dreaded war, to Thad. Stevens, who represented in Congress
the Pennsylvania iron interest, and, in his character and person,
the worst element of the worst politics that America ever
saw.</p>

<p>Lincoln had no warrant in the Constitution for calling out
the militia against the seceded States. "The Congress shall
have power to declare war" (Article I, section 8, clause 11);
and "The Congress shall have power to raise and support
armies" (Article I, section 8, clause 12); and if, in violation
of standard definition and contrary to the fact, it be said that
what he inaugurated was not war, but was only an armed
effort to put down insurrection, the Constitution, Article I,
section 8, clause 15, replies: "The Congress shall have power
to provide for the calling out of the militia to execute the
laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."
So the only warrant the President had was an old act of Congress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
passed February 28, 1795, shortly after the Whiskey
Insurrection. This act provided: "That whenever the laws
of the United States shall be opposed in any State by combinations
too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course
of judicial proceedings or the power vested in the marshals
by this act, it shall be lawful for the President of the United
States to call forth the militia of such State or of any other
State or States, as may be necessary to suppress such combinations
and cause the laws to be duly executed." No pretense
of authority was given when a State or a combination of States
opposed the United States. His construction forestalled Congress
and robbed it of its exclusive right and power to "declare
war," and made him the sole arbiter to dictate the
nation's weal or woe.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this law, thus misconstrued, was obsolete,
and so marked in the reprint of the United States Statutes
at Large, in 1845, authorized by Congress. Lincoln,
then, "by and with the advice and consent" of interested
persons, utterly ignoring the two coordinate branches of government,
unearthed for the purpose of inaugurating a most
frightful war an old statute, unused from the time of its
passage, and standing on the authoritative Revised Statutes
marked "obsolete" for sixteen years&mdash;so received by the lawyers,
and unchallenged by Congress or any member thereof.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that Congress, when it did assemble, in
July, 1861, and found war a fact accomplished and armies
already threatening Washington, should have made haste to
validate the President's high-handed measures and strengthen
his precarious position by an act of which section three is as
follows: "That all the acts, proclamations, and orders, of
the President of the United States, after the 4th of March,
1861, respecting the army and navy of the United States, and
the calling out, or relating to the militia or volunteers from
the States, are hereby approved and in all respects legalized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and made valid to the same intent and with the same effect
as if they had been issued and done under previous express
authority and direction of the Congress of the United States."
The marginal note of the printed laws points this act specially
to the proclamation of April 15, 1861, calling out the militia.</p>

<p>In suppressing the Whiskey Insurrection Washington acted
under the "previous express authority of Congress," then
lately given, "cautiously in his delicate duty," while Hamilton
"was pressing for the collection of the revenue," says
history. The act under which the militia was then called out,
passed in 1792, required a Federal judge to certify the fact
of the insurrection, and Washington took care to arm himself
with the certificate of a Supreme Court Justice. The act
under which <em>Lincoln</em> proceeded, an epitome of the former,
shows on its face that it was also, when in force, in aid exclusively
of court proceedings, and operative only when a
Federal judge should call upon the President to assist the
United States Marshals, who were purely court officers. Any
other construction gives the President "the power to suppress
insurrections," and the "power to declare war"; and, when
war is declared the Constitution places him in command of
the army and militia: so nothing would be left for Congress
but to vote supplies and validate his acts, as it did Lincoln's
usurpations!</p>

<p>Though the militia had often been needed, and sometimes
called out for troubles, domestic and foreign, no President of
the United States, until Lincoln, had ever issued such a call
unless expressly authorized by Congress, in special acts of
limited duration, which have usually specified the number of
troops wanted and the term of service required. It is no
wonder then that an act, treated as a dead letter since the
suppression of the Whiskey Insurrection, should have been
marked "obsolete" by the government publisher, with the
sanction of Congress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless Madison's refusal to recommend a policy of coercion
against the New England States, successfully resisting the
drafts for the defense of the nation in the War of 1812, be
regarded as a precedent, Lincoln had but one, directly in
point, and that was furnished by President Jackson in the
case of South Carolina's nullification of Federal law in 1832.
Jackson's zeal for the Union could not be doubted; and, in
spite of his military training and arbitrary temper, he found
a remedy which saved the Union without bloodshed.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1832, after South Carolina had nullified
the tariff act, proceeded to provide a separate government, notified
the President, and begun to arm and organize its militia
for defense, Jackson issued a proclamation in which he besought,
and threatened, and promised. Failing by such
means to induce the tariff-plundered planters of the plucky
little State to recede from their position, on the assembling
of Congress he recommended the removal of the cause of the
trouble, expressing his belief that such action would shortly
put an end to resistance. Nullification still continuing, Jackson
(a month later) wrote his famous message, in which he
called attention to the magnitude of the opposition, and recommended
to Congress to provide by law: "That in case
of an attempt otherwise [than by process from the ordinary
judicial tribunals of the United States] to take property [from
the custody of the law] by a force too great to be overcome by
the officers of the customs, it should be lawful to protect the
possessions of the officers by the employment of the land and
naval forces and militia under provisions similar to those authorized
by the eleventh section of the Act of January 9,
1809." After recommending the revival of other expired
acts to facilitate and protect the collection of the revenues and
execution of Federal law, he said further: "Provisions less
than these&mdash;consisting, as they do, for the most part, rather of
a revival of the policy of former acts called for by the [then]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
existing emergency, than of the introduction of any unusual
or rigorous enactments&mdash;would not cause the laws of the
Union to be properly respected or enforced. It is believed
that these would prove adequate unless the military forces of
the State of South Carolina, authorized by the late act of the
Legislature, should be actually embodied and called out in
aid of their proceedings, and of the provisions of the ordinance
generally. Even in that case, however, it is believed
that no more will be necessary than a few modifications of its
terms to adapt the Act of 1795 to the present emergency, as by
that act the provisions of the Act of 1792 were accommodated
to the crisis then existing; and, by conferring authority upon
the President, to give it operation during the session of Congress,
and without the ceremony of a proclamation, whenever
it shall be officially made known to him by the authority
of any State, or by the courts of the United States, that,
within the limits of such State, the laws of the United States
will be openly opposed and their execution obstructed by the
actual employment of military force, or by any unlawful
means, whatever, too great to be otherwise overcome."</p>

<p>Pursuant to these recommendations, Congress passed,
March 2, 1833, the "force bill," or "bloody bill," as it was
called; and the section which made it infamous in the unprotected
States was as follows: "Sec. 5. And be it further
enacted, that whenever the President of the United States
shall be officially informed by the authorities of any State, or
by a judge of any Circuit or District Court of the United
States in the State, that within the limits of such State any
law or laws of the United States, or the execution thereof, or
of any process from the courts of the United States is obstructed
by the employment of military force, or by any other
unlawful means too great to be overcome by the ordinary
course of judicial proceedings or by the power vested in the
marshals by existing laws, it shall be lawful for him, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
President of the United States, forthwith to issue his proclamation
declaring such fact or information, and requiring all
such military or other force forthwith to disperse; and if, at
any time after issuing such proclamation, any such opposition
or obstruction shall be made in the manner or by the means
aforesaid, the President shall be and hereby is authorized
promptly to employ such means to suppress the same, and to
cause said laws or process to be duly executed, as are authorized
and provided in the cases therein mentioned by the Act
of the 28th of February, 1795, entitled: 'An act to provide
for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the
Union, suppress insurrections, repel invasions, and repeal the
act now in force for that purpose'; and also, by the Act of
the 3d of March, 1807, entitled: 'An act authorizing the
employment of the land and naval forces of the United
States in cases of insurrection.'" Section 1 of the force bill
authorized the President to call out the army, navy, and
militia to aid in collecting the <em>customs</em>&mdash;a power which the
Act of 1795 could not be construed to give. It was also
provided in the act that the operation of said sections 5 and 1
should "continue until the next session of Congress, and no
longer." Thus careful was Congress to limit the duration of
the great powers delegated to the President, as it had usually
done in other instances in which it had authorized the employment
of military force. The Act of March 3, 1807,
referred to in the force bill, simply gave the President
authority to use the land and naval forces of the United
States to assist in the execution of the laws whenever it
should be lawful for him to call out the militia for the
same purpose. The Act of 1795, referred to by Jackson,
which he did not pretend he had a right to use against
the nullifiers of the tariff act, unless it should be revived
by Congress, and which he proposed should be revived,
modified, and adapted to meet the emergency confronting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
him, in the same way Congress had formerly adapted and
modified the Act of 1792 by the Act of 1795, to meet the
emergency of the latter year, was the very act Lincoln used
to cover his assumption of power to make war on the South
without the authority of Congress! He had this precedent
before him, in which the warrior Jackson, swift in defense
of the nation's honor against her foreign foes, was slow to dye
his hands in his brothers' blood. He had before him the act in
which Congress had revived the provisions of the Act of 1795,
and expressly limited the duration of that revival to the time
intervening before its next session; and he was lawyer enough
to know, though not learned in his profession, that the substantial
reenactment and enlargement of the old act, and its
repeal, or limitation to a definite period, was, after the expiration
of that period, a practical repeal of both&mdash;especially when
it may be seen that the one was to take the place the other
took in its day. See <i>Tynen</i> vs. <i>The United States</i>, 11 Wallace
U. S. Reports, page 88; <i>Pana</i> vs. <i>Bowles</i>, 107 U. S. Reports,
page 529, and cases cited therein; <i>Norris</i> vs. <i>Crocker</i>,
13 Howard, page 429.</p>

<p>Jackson, in spite of his camp association and military methods,
was the embodiment of caution and conservatism, when
compared to Lincoln and his "kitchen cabinet" of revenue-hunting
Governors, who were as swift to declare war against
their own people, under a forced construction of an old, unused,
obsolete, special act, as those who now speculate in their
names and fame are eager to seek treaties of partnership with
our hereditary foreign foe.</p>

<p>They shall never, unchallenged, teach our children that
Abraham Lincoln's usurpations were lawful, justified by necessity,
or commended by God; lest "necessity, the plea of
tyrants," or "divine right," the plea of kings and priests, or
"implied powers," the plea of those who are powerful only
to oppress the people and to collect and spend their revenues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
should constitute the excuse for destroying the remaining
safeguards of our liberties.</p>

<p>Those accustomed to analyze motive and conduct will note
with attention that the Act of August 6, 1861, intended to
legalize the call for troops, was passed after the "force bill"
had been reenacted and amplified by the Acts of July 13,
29, and 31, 1861&mdash;after the President had been expressly
authorized by these acts and another to accept the service of
volunteers and to use the army, navy, and militia to make
war upon <em>States and combinations of States</em>, as well as upon
the inhabitants of districts therein&mdash;after Congress had in
these acts twice gone out of its way to refer to the old Act of
1795 as still in force, and once expressly treated it as giving
the authority, which had been assumed, to begin the war; and
the legalizing act itself was covered under a caption which was
calculated to excite as little attention as possible. The caption
reads: "An act to increase the pay of privates in the
regular army and in the volunteers, and for other purposes."</p>

<p>The Act of 1795, when in force, gave the President no
authority to determine when a state of insurrection existed,
even in a Federal district; Congress proved that it realized this
defect of power by hastening (July 13 and 29, 1861) to supply
it to Lincoln&mdash;in respect to States as well as districts&mdash;a
double confession of the weakness of his position.</p>

<p>The Act of 1795 afforded no assistance to collect customs,
for the Whiskey Insurrectionists, against whom it was passed,
resisted only the internal revenue taxes; Congress practically
acknowledged this limitation, by Act of July 13, 1861,
expressly and separately authorizing the President to use the
army, navy, and militia to "collect the customs" of the
United States.</p>

<p>"Even our enemies themselves being judges," there were
doubts everywhere, and these doubts were everywhere resolved
in favor of absolute authority and against the received
construction of law and the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>An executive who usurps powers ought to be placed on a
moral plane as much lower than that of a treasurer who embezzles
public funds as the love of liberty in the minds of
the virtuous is higher than the love of money.</p>

<p>Those who would derive Lincoln's assumed power to declare
war from the clause of the Constitution which requires
that the "President shall see that the laws are faithfully executed"
betray the flimsy foundation upon which they would
erect the throne of an autocrat. The faithful execution of
the laws is to be secured in a lawful manner, under such powers
as the Constitution gives or Congress may lawfully give to
the President. If he is the sole judge of the extent of the
powers conferred and the appropriateness of the means of
execution, he does not need any other clause to make him
the field-overseer of both the other departments of government;
and this the Supreme Court has decided he is not.
<i>Tyndall</i> vs. <i>The United States</i>, 12 Peters, p. 524. Lincoln
did not rely upon this clause, but upon the Act of 1795, the
language of which he quoted in his call for the militia of
the States; and Congress, by the fifth section of the Act of
July 13, 1861, showed very plainly that it recognized that he
had professed to act under the Statute of 1795.</p>

<p>The frightful experiences of the civil war and the serpent-brood
of evils which have since followed in its trail are plenary
proof that the fathers were wise in not lodging the war power
in the hands of any one man.</p>

<p>A summary of Lincoln's conduct, while there was yet peace
in the land, brings out in startling relief the facts: that he
dared at the behest of pampered privilege greedy for revenue,
and partisan rancor thirsting for blood, without precedent, or
the support of either of the other branches of the government,
to place his own private interpretation upon a statute,
in effect repealed, and thereby to make war on six millions
of his fellow-citizens, whom he refused a right of opinion sustained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
by abundant authority and precedent and by some of
his own acts and utterances. The idol of the "higher law"
fanatics, the chief of whom he placed in his cabinet&mdash;nominated
on a platform which denounced the Supreme Court decision
in the Dred Scott case as "a dangerous political heresy,
revolutionary in its tendency and subversive of the peace and
harmony of the country"&mdash;elected by States, many of which
defied Federal authority attempting to execute the fugitive
slave law, and none of which supported such authority, except
New Jersey and California&mdash;and having never publicly or
privately condemned the nullification of their constitutional
obligations (Article IV, section 2, clause 3) by the States of
Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Maine, Wisconsin, Kansas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania&mdash;he
still proclaimed that his only motive in taking up the sword
was to assert the paramount authority of Federal law!</p>

<p>His political campaign of 1864 was fought upon a platform
which pledged its supporters to "bring to punishment due
their crimes the rebels and traitors arrayed against the Government";
and be it remembered by all posterity that at the
end of that campaign, almost at the close of a successful war,
and in spite of military interference at the polls, one million
eight hundred and eight thousand seven hundred and twenty-five
citizens of his own section voted to condemn him, and
endorsed a platform which declared that "under pretense of
a military necessity for a war power higher than the Constitution,
the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every
part" by him, and that "justice, humanity, liberty, and the
public welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for a
cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate convention
of all the States; * * * that peace may be restored on the
basis of the Federal Union of all the States," * * * that the
aim of their party was "to preserve the Federal Union and
the rights of all the States unimpaired," and that they considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"the administrative usurpations of extraordinary and
dangerous powers not granted by the Constitution * * * as
calculated to prevent a restoration of the Union; that the
shameful disregard of the administration of its duty to our
fellow-citizens, * * * prisoners of war, deserves the severest
reprobation."</p>

<p>As at the beginning, so at the end of the war, a vast majority
of our nation was opposed to Lincoln's policy of coercion
and blood; for his total vote, with the army and navy to
back him, was only about four hundred thousand in excess of
McClellan's, and this would have been far more than offset
by the Southern vote.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of Lincoln's death was a sentence in
his speech of April 11, 1865: "If universal amnesty is
granted to the insurgents I cannot see how I can avoid exacting,
in return, universal suffrage, or, at least, suffrage on a
basis of intelligence and military service." "That means
nigger citizenship," said his slayer to a witness. "Now, by
God, I'll put him through!"&mdash;<cite>Life of Lincoln</cite>, by Herndon
and Weik, Vol. III, p. 579.</p>

<p>It was a singular decree of Providence that, according to
his own forebodings, Lincoln should have perished by the
hand of violence, and that too on the fatal 15th of April, the
anniversary of his proclamation for the seventy-five thousand
volunteers to begin the dance of death. "He that killeth
with the sword must be killed with the sword."</p>

<p>Let us be as thankful as we can that we are still one nation,
that African slavery has ceased, and that the safeguards of
liberty may be still sufficient if we are vigilant, unselfish, and
brave.</p>

<p>The world has long respected the courage of the South;
when the whole truth shall be well told it will equally respect
her cause. One obvious effect of the civil war, clearly foreseen
and foretold by Southern statesmen, was to Europeanize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
American institutions. This was a fearful price to pay even
for keeping the sections under one government.</p>

<p>Let us hope that the present war with Spain may destroy
the stock-in-trade of the speculator in past patriotism.</p>

<p>An unoccupied field of investigation for a future historian
is the part which Great Britain played in dissension, disunion,
and war between the States, the sections, and the political
parties. Her purpose has been accomplished. She has annihilated

her own supremacy&mdash;and has thereby made us a third-rate

<p>"Will your people divide?" General Clingman was frequently
asked while in England in 1860. Never once was
he asked if slavery would be abolished. The form of the
question, in a land where abolition took its rise, struck him
forcibly. Hear its explanation: "In this connection I remember
a statement made to me by the late American Minister
at Paris, Mr. Mason. He spoke of having had a conversation
with one whose name I do not feel at liberty to mention,
but whose influence on the opinion of continental Europe
is considerable, who declared to him that if the Union of our
States continued at no distant day we should control the
world; and, therefore, as an European, he felt it to be his
duty to press anti-slavery views as the only chance to divide
us. I have many reasons to know that the monarchies of
Europe, threatened with downfall from revolutionary movements,
seek, through such channels as they control, to make
similar impressions."&mdash;<cite>Speeches and Writings of T. L. Clingman</cite>,

<p>Lloyd Garrison seems to have been a sincere fanatic, but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the better may have served British policy. Listen to a group
of facts about him, appearing at random in a friendly encyclopedia:
"In 1833" [the year the stars fell] "he visited Great
Britain, and on his return organized 'The American Anti-slavery
Society.' He visited England again in 1846, 1848,
and 1867, in which last year he was publicly breakfasted in
St. James' Hall."</p>

<p>An extract from the <cite>London Telegraph</cite> of 1856 contains
food for thought: "The aggressive spirit of the people of
the United States requires an humbling, and it is for us to perform
the task. England's mission is to complete the great
work commenced by her in 1834, when she liberated her
slaves. There are now over three million human beings in
cruel bondage in the United States. If, therefore, the United
States Government deny, and is resolved to question the right
of Great Britain to her Central American possessions, we, the
people of the British empire, are resolved to strike off the
shackles from the feet of her three million slaves."</p>

<p>The <cite>London News</cite>, also of about the same time, encouraging
its people against the possibility of rupture between England
and this country, said: "However strong is the unprincipled
appeal at present made to the anti-British feeling
of the Northern States, that feeling is counterbalanced by another
which has grown up within the last quarter of a century.
<em>The abolitionists would be with us to a man. The best of
them are so now.</em>"</p>

<p>In 1798 the federalistic school of tax-gatherers, under the
guidance of their founders, Rufus King and Hamilton, once
actually lifted their eyes from the plunder of their own
countrymen long enough to adopt an aggressive foreign policy,
but it was a conspiracy with England, called the "Mirandy
Plot," by which they sought to despoil our late allies in our
war for independence, the French people, of their territory
beyond the Mississippi, the honest and honorable purchase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
which by Jefferson, a few years later, this school denounced
as unconstitutional and void.</p>

<p>Better than any American statesman, General Clingman
seems to have understood the motives and interests of Great
Britain in fomenting the slavery agitation and the estrangement
of the sections. Hear him, in his address to the people
of the Eighth Congressional District of North Carolina,
March 16, 1856: "The United States is the great republic
of the earth, and the example of our free institutions was
shaking the foundations of the monarchical and aristocratic
governments of Europe. This was especially the case as respects
the political system of Great Britain, owing to our
common language, literature, and extended commercial intercourse.
The aristocracy there hold the mass of the people
in subjection, and under a condition so oppressive that large
numbers of white men of their own race are liable to perish
miserably by famine in years of scarcity. A knowledge of
the successful working of our institutions was increasing the
discontent of the common people, and, fearing the loss of its
sway, the aristocracy, which controls the entire power of the
government, began a crusade for the abolition of slavery in
the United States. They expected, in the first place, by affected
sympathy for the negroes here, to divert the minds
of the people at home, to some extent, from the consideration
of their own sufferings, and to create the impression that other
laborers were much worse off than their own. And should
they succeed in breaking up our system they would exultingly
point to it as an evidence against the durability of free institutions.</p>

<p>"With a view, therefore, to effect these objects, more than
twenty years ago the British press, and book-makers generally
were stimulated to embark in a systematic war against negro
slavery in the United States. Abolition lecturers were sent
over and money furnished to establish papers and circulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pamphlets to inflame the minds of the citizens of the Northern
States.</p>

<p>"Looking far ahead, they sought to incorporate their doctrines
into the school-books and publications best calculated
to influence the minds of the young and ignorant. Their
views were most readily received in Massachusetts, where
British influence has, for the last half century, been greatest.
From this State these doctrines were gradually diffused to a
great extent throughout the North."</p>

<p>At the time that the British politicians were taking so much
interest in the slavery question of America, and deprecating
with many crocodile tears our treatment of the negroes they
had sold us, the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> of January, 1856, charges
the British Government with collecting rents and taxes from
its subjects in India by means of the thumb-screw and other
tortures as devilish as ingenuity could devise. See <cite>Speeches
and Writings of T. L. Clingman</cite>.</p>

<p>According to some New England testimony, the work of
the British emissaries who had been sent out to divide the
Union was uphill at first. Hear the words of Representative
Isaac Hill, from New Hampshire, speaking in Congress
in 1836: "I have said the people of the North were more
united in their opposition to the plans of the advocates of
anti-slavery than on any other subject. This opposition is
confined to no political party. It pervades every class of the
community. They deprecate all interference with the subject
of slavery because they believe such interference may involve
the existence and welfare of the Union itself, and because
they understand the obligations which the non-slaveholding
States owe to the slaveholding States by the compact
of confederation. It is the strong desire to perpetuate the
Union; it is the determination which every patriotic and virtuous
citizen has made in no event to abandon the 'ark of
our safety' that now impels the united North to take its stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
against the agitators of the anti-slavery project. So effectually
has the strong public sentiment put down that agitation
in New England that it is now kept alive only by the power
of money which the agitators have collected and apply in the
hiring of agents and in the issue from presses that are kept in
their employ.</p>

<p>"The anti-slavery movement which brings in petitions
from various parts of the country, asking Congress to abolish
slavery in the District of Columbia, originates with a few persons
who have been in the habit of making charitable religious
institutions subservient to political purposes, and who
have even controlled some of those charitable associations.</p>

<p>"Many of the clergymen who have been the instruments
of the agitators have been such from no bad motive. Some
of them, discovering the purpose of the agitators, discovering
that their labors were calculated to make the condition of
the slave worse, and to create animosity between the people of
the North and the South, have paused in their course and desisted
from the further application of a mistaken philanthropy."</p>

<p>Even if it be admitted that, as early as the year 1836, the
strongest elements in New England were united against the
South, it is by no means true that they were then unanimous
in selecting slavery as the most advantageous ground of battle.
A cry of distress arose from Great Britain at the way
some of the distributors of her secret service money were being
treated; a paragraph from an English newspaper, the
<cite>Leeds Mercury</cite>, read on the floor of the House of Representatives
by Mr. King, of Georgia, in corroboration of what Mr.
Hill had said, will serve as an illustration: "Letters of the
most distressing nature have been received from Mr. George
Thompson, the zealous and devoted missionary of slave emancipation,
who has gone from this country to the United States,
and who writes from Boston. He says that 'the North (that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is, New England, where slavery does not exist) has universally
sympathized with the South in opposition to the abolitionists;
that the North has let fall the mask; that the merchants
and mechanics, priests and politicians have alike stood
forth the defenders of Southern despots and the furious denouncers
of Northern philanthropy'; that all parties of politics,
especially the supporters of the two rival candidates for
the Presidential office (Van Buren and Webster) vie with
each other in denouncing the abolitionists; and that even religious
men shun them, except when the abolitionists can
fairly gain a hearing from them. With regard to himself
he speaks as follows: 'Rewards are offered for my abduction
and assassination; and, in every direction, I meet with
those who believe they would be doing God and their country
service by depriving me of life. I have appeared in public,
and some of my escapes from the hands of my foes have been
truly providential. On Friday last I narrowly escaped losing
my life in Concord, New Hampshire.' 'Boston, September
11.&mdash;This morning a short gallows was found standing opposite
the door of my house, 23 Bay street, in this city, now occupied
by Garrison. Two halters hung from the beam, with
the words above them: By Order of Judge Lynch!'"</p>

<p>Responding to this, the New Hampshire Representative
(Hill) said: "The present agitation in the North is kept up
by the application of money; it is a state of things altogether
forced. Agents are hired, disguised in the character of ministers
of the gospel, to preach abolition of slavery where
slavery does not exist; and presses are kept in constant employment
to scatter abolition publications through the country."</p>

<p>Yes, and this constant "application" of money finally
overcame the Yankee. The love of it has been the root of
much evil with him. Then, too, eventually, his politicians
and manufacturers found that the best use they could make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the negro was to hold him betwixt them and the fire of
Southern indignation, kindled by their cupidity.</p>

<p>To show the dangerous reciprocity of feeling between old
and New England long before it was intensified as it now is
by the community of interest in untold millions of investments,
the words uttered by John Quincy Adams, the sixth
President of the United States, fall with the weight of state's
evidence: "That their object (<i>i. e.</i> that of the New England
States) was, and had been for several years, a dissolution
of the Union and the establishment of a separate confederation,
he knew from unequivocal evidence, although not
provable in a court of law; and that in case of a civil war the
aid of Great Britain to effect that purpose would as assuredly
be resorted to as it would be indispensably necessary to their
design."&mdash;<cite>Adams' letter in reply to Harrison Gray Otis and
others</cite>, December 28, 1828, quoted by Raphael Semmes in
his <cite>Memoirs of Service Afloat</cite>, p. 43. This attachment to
British interests was so pronounced in 1812 that the New
England States refused to furnish their quota of troops to
help conduct our defense; and, while the nation was locked in
deadly conflict with the ruthless invader, these States actually
held a convention at Hartford looking to secession. The
Governor of Massachusetts proclaimed a public fast day for
deploring a war against a nation which had long been "the
bulwark of the religion we profess"; its Supreme Court decided
that neither the President nor Congress could control
its State troops in time of war, and the Legislature declared
the war to be unholy, and urged its people to do what they
could to thwart it. These States forced a treaty of peace
in which Great Britain was not even required to cease the
outrages on account of which the war was undertaken&mdash;outrages
which might have been begun again but for Jackson's
victory with the Southern soldiers at New Orleans. Jefferson,
in a letter to Lafayette, says: "During that war four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the Eastern States were only attached to the Union like so
many inanimate bodies to living men."</p>

<p>That will be the saddest chapter of American history which
faithfully compares the treasonable obstruction of these States
to this war with their Cain-like swiftness to shed their brothers'
blood because of an alleged difference of opinion on a
question of constitutional law. It will be remembered, in
this connection, that these States had their troops mobilized
and waiting for the President's call before Fort Sumter was
fired on. In four days after the call the troops of Massachusetts
(the most protected State save one) had invaded the
State of Maryland and were shooting down the astonished and
outraged citizens of Baltimore.</p>

<p>The next saddest chapter of our national history will show
that the section which has been greediest to gain power from
the States and revenues from the people has been the readiest
to use these powers and revenues against those from whom they
were stolen, and the most reluctant to use them to defend the
nation against foreign aggressions. "It is a principle of
human nature," remarks Tacitus, "to hate those we have injured
more than those who have injured us."</p>

<p>And who, now, but the beneficiaries of implied powers
(which they fought a civil war to preserve and maintain in
all their latitude), under real or affected dread of a foreign
war, are zealous for the late proposed bondholders' treaty with
England? As though that nation could afford to kill or
even injure the goose which lays the golden egg in the shape
of four hundred million dollars annual interest on British investments
in this country! The sole purpose of this treaty
is that this egg shall be <em>golden</em> and not <em>bimetallic</em>; and instead
of preventing, it may be the cause of war, as soon as
the people resume control of their government and feel the
effects of an arbitration judgment on the financial question.
I pause to remark, in this connection, that many well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
people who petitioned the Senate for the confirmation of this
treaty had not read it with sufficient care to observe that it
delegated to a commission, composed partly of foreigners and
to a majority of the Senate, powers which have heretofore
been only exercised by two-thirds of the Senate, as the Constitution
provides. And this apparently slight though subtle
change in the conduct of our government was sought to be
inaugurated in the name of peace!</p>

<p>What a Southern statesman exclaimed, arguing against the
adoption of the Federal Constitution, in 1787, may be appositely
repeated here: "But the character of the partners
(meaning the Northern States) causes me more alarm than the
terms of the partnership." England's partnership with Australia,
South Africa, and India has spread such a pall of universal
indebtedness over the fairest portions of the globe that
we may well hesitate before we make more permanent the
stipulations in the "bond" of her blighting friendship.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the seeds of the War of 1812 were sown by
the treaty of 1794, negotiated by John Jay, who took "a mild
and conciliatory part in the Revolutionary war," and by Lord
Grenville, the son of the author of the Stamp Act. The
"Jay treaty," as it was called, provided for the shameful curtailment
of the American ocean-carrying trade, and for the
free navigation of the Mississippi for Great Britain. And if
the proposed arbitration treaty is not finally rejected by the
Senate, the prominence given to the present British Minister
at McKinley's inauguration, accidental though it may have
been, will serve as a fine prototype of British influence in the
administration of our government.</p>

<p>"Woe to the nation that trusts England's friendship," exclaimed
the thoughtful Pettigrew, after studying her national
character on the narrow island where it grew. What he says,
given under the sketch of him in this book, is a valuable side-light
upon the suggestion that her influence more than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
other (except original sin) has changed the half of our nation
nearest to her into a race of "dollar-hunters and breeders of
dollar-hunters." The way to make England our ally is to
show her that we are able to take care of ourselves. Her
government fears nothing so much as the democratic spirit
of America, and would fain bind that down by treaty; but
when it serves her purposes, Old England, like New England,
finds a "higher law" than a contract. Unity of interest and
of purpose unites peoples&mdash;compacts often unite governments
in a conspiracy to plunder.</p>

<p>In dwelling specially upon the main cause of our civil
war, because of attempts to ignore it, I do not mean to encourage
the student to neglect the other causes: the control
by the Confederacy of the lower Mississippi&mdash;the ocean outlet
of its headwater States; the fear of protected labor that the
slaves would learn to manufacture, and reduce wages; the
jealousy and friction in the newly-settled West, caused by the
actual contact of the two systems of labor (for slavery was a
practical and serious question there); the belief that slavery
was at the bottom of the forty-four years of sectional political
wrangling, and that this must cease or the Union be dissolved;
the honest and the prejudiced opposition to the institution itself;
the zeal and ambition of machine politicians, in both
sections, anxious to get in "on the ground floor" of personal
advantage&mdash;these together, acted on by the main cause, and
reacting on each other, constitute the causes of the war.</p>

<p>And it must not be forgotten, too, that Calhoun, for the
South, accepted the slavery issue as the gage of battle, though
he knew for what purpose it was manufactured. Unity of the
South against Northern aggression was what he was fighting
for; and, having failed to present a solid front against the
tariff because Clay's ambition and Louisiana's influence disintegrated
his forces in the Southwest, he was the more easily
betrayed into adopting a temporary expedient&mdash;the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
shifting the issue from its high ground. In this way, too, he
got "hay and stubble" in his foundation, and gave the enemies
of civil liberty among the whites a chance to pose as the
friends of civil liberty among the blacks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Standing among the statutes at large, with but a page between,
is the proclamation of Thomas Jefferson, thundering
against the aggressions of Great Britain, and the proclamation
of John Adams, breathing out threatenings and slaughter
against his own countrymen for resisting the plunder of an
unjust revenue tax. These two proclamations, looming up in
the horizon of American history like the Mountains of Blessing
and Cursing, are the embodiment of the two spirits which
are contending for the mastery of this nation&mdash;the one the
source of our independence gained by a foreign war and the
territory on this side of the Mississippi, and of our independence
maintained by a foreign war and the territory beyond
the Mississippi&mdash;the other the source of our national debt in
its monstrous cumulation, of Federal extravagance, of sectional
expenditures of public funds, of class legislation for
protected industries, of unequal taxes, and of a frightful civil
war, unlawfully begun to collect them.</p>

<p>"To do justice" is the only way to "insure domestic tranquillity."
A government is "strong" only when its foundations
are laid deep in the affections and best interests of the
people who support it and for whose benefit it was created.
God's government is strong and will last forever because it is
based upon the eternal principle of mutual affinity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Through the long mystery of prehistoric ages the spirit of
God's love brooded over the desolation of a void and formless
world; continents laden with life were born out of the womb
of the great deep&mdash;Life which still lives in the love of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Infinite Author&mdash;and the great deep which still with measured
pulse is beating out the changes of our times and booming
in our ears the faith that we, too, are somewhere in the
sweep of Nature's mighty moving heart. So, statesmen and
philosophers, deeply pondering in love of country over the
dreary waste of failures and disasters lying thick along the
track of History and Experience, have wrought out for us wise
laws and constitutions, have rescued from the "bottomless
deep of theory and possibility" the institutions under which
we live, but the virtue to interpret and maintain them is not
transmitted nor transmissible&mdash;that we must gain, as they did,
from Heaven.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sloping in a long, gradual sweep of undulating hills and
valleys, overspread with the silver network of her myriad
streams, from her lofty green-bannered battlements, erected
by God, down to her shifting shore, where Hatteras lies in
wait for her enemies by sea, North Carolina spreads out the
peaceful lap of her bounteous land for her children and for
all who cherish her.</p>

<p>Born before the Union, which is but an offspring of the
States, and surviving disunion, the child of sectional advantage,
unbroken by the shock of radical changes in the Constitutions
of the State and nation, North Carolina stands
among the firmest of the forty-five pillars of the national superstructure,
will sustain it as long as it answers the purposes
of its creation, and, if greed or necessity or the will of Heaven
should destroy it, will stand above its wreck, the sure foundation
and protection of her people's liberties and the sure support
of a more perfect Union of the States which have been
purified in the crucible of disaster.</p>

<small>BY WALTER CLARK</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>William Richardson Davie was born at Egremont, near
Whitehaven, Cumberland county, in the north of England,
on June 20, 1756. He was brought over to this country by
his father, Archibald Davie, who, upon the peace of 1763,
made a visit to America, and was left in the care of his
maternal uncle, Rev. William Richardson, a Presbyterian
clergyman residing in the Waxhaw settlement on the Catawba
river, in South Carolina. Having no children, Mr. Richardson
adopted his nephew and namesake, who became heir to
his estate. At the usual age young Davie was sent to the
"Queen's Museum," the well-known academy and high
school in Charlotte. From thence he entered at Nassau
Hall, Princeton College, New Jersey, of which the famous
Dr. Witherspoon was then President. In the summer of
1776, with the consent of the President, a party of students,
among whom Davie was one, was raised and served as volunteers
in the patriot army. In the fall of that year he returned
to college, and, passing his examinations, took his college degree
of Bachelor of Arts with the first honors of the institution.
His uncle died before his return home. Davie selected
the profession of law and began his studies at Salisbury. In
1777 he joined a detachment of twelve hundred men under
General Jones, ordered to be raised for the defense of Charleston,
then threatened with another attack, but on reaching
Camden it was found that the design was abandoned by the
enemy, and the detachment returned home after a service of
three months. In 1779 a troop of cavalry was raised in the
Salisbury district. Of this William Barnett, of Mecklenburg,
was chosen captain and Davie lieutenant. His commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
signed by Governor Caswell, is dated 5 April, 1779.
With two hundred horse he was immediately sent into the
back country to suppress a Tory rising, but it was quelled before
their arrival. Soon afterward the troop joined the
Southern Army and was attached to Pulaski's Legion.</p>

<p>Captain Barnett having resigned, Davie was promoted to
captain, and shortly thereafter was made major. On June
20th of that year Davie took part in the battle of Stono, near
Charleston. In this battle the North Carolina brigade was
commanded by General Jethro Sumner. In a cavalry charge
on that day Davie was wounded and fell from his horse, but
retained hold of the bridle. The cavalry, dispirited by his
fall, were in full retreat when a private in another company,
whose horse had been shot under him and was carrying off
his saddle, saw Major Davie standing by his horse unable to
mount him, his thigh being disabled by his wound. Though
the enemy were in a few yards, this man deliberately placed
him on his horse and led him from the field. His deliverer
then disappeared and resumed his place in the ranks, and
Davie could find no trace of him. The wound was a severe
one and kept Davie long in the hospital at Charleston, rendering
him incapable of further service that year. At the
siege of Ninety-Six, two years later, when Davie was present
as Commissary-General of the Southern Army, on the morning
of the attack a stranger came to his tent and introduced
himself as the man who had saved his life at Stono. He
promised to visit him again, but when the troops were recalled
from the fruitless attempt to storm the fort the body
of the gallant unknown was found among the dead. On his
return from the Charleston hospital in September, 1779,
Davie being unfit for service, applied for and received his
County Court license and was sent by the Governor to attend
the courts on the Holston river, then in North Carolina, that
he might ascertain public sentiment in that section. In the
spring of 1780 he received his Superior Court license. About
the same time he obtained authority from the Legislature of
North Carolina to raise a troop of cavalry and two companies
of mounted infantry. The authority was all that the State
could give, its funds being too low to provide the means.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Major Davie, with a patriotism worthy of perpetual remembrance,
disposed of the estate inherited from his uncle and
thus raised the funds to equip his command.</p>

<p>The surrender of Charleston, 12th May, 1780, and the
surprise and butchery of Buford's men by Colonel Tarleton
on the 29th of the same month, completed the subjugation of
South Carolina. Colonel Moore, with eleven hundred Tories,
having collected at Ramsour's Mills, in the edge of the present
town of Lincolnton, Colonel Francis Locke with three
hundred militia of Burke, Lincoln, and Rowan, crossed the
Catawba at Beattie's Ford, while General Rutherford, acting
in concert with him with seven hundred troops, among whom
was Davie and his command, crossed at Tuckaseege Ford.
The two divisions were to meet in the night near the enemy
and attack at break of day. Rutherford's march being circuitous,
was delayed, but Colonel Locke, notwithstanding the
disparity of force, attacked alone and won a complete victory.
Rutherford arrived about an hour after the action and dispatched
Major Davie in pursuit of the fugitives. Shortly
after Major Davie was ordered to take post near the South
Carolina line, opposite Hanging Rock, to prevent the enemy
from foraging and to check the depredations of the Tories
who infested that section. He was reenforced by some South
Carolinians under Major Crawford, by thirty-five Catawba Indians
under their chief, New River, and by part of the Mecklenburg
militia. With part of his dragoons and some volunteers
he left camp 20th July, 1780, to intercept a convoy of
provisions and clothing destined for the enemy at Hanging
Rock, eighteen miles distant. Marching all night, he turned
the enemy's flank and fell into the Camden road five miles
below Hanging Rock. Here he awaited the convoy, which
appeared in the afternoon, and it was surprised and completely
captured, with all the stores.</p>

<p>About the last of July, Colonel Sumter, with the South
Carolina refugees, and Colonel Irwin, with the North Carolina
troops, advanced to the attack of Rocky Mount, while
Major Davie was to make a diversion to engage the attention
of the enemy at Hanging Rock. His detachment consisted
of eighty mounted men. In sight of the enemy's camp, he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
upon three companies of their mounted infantry returning
from an excursion. Taken by surprise, they were literally cut
to pieces almost before they were aware of his presence. Sixty
valuable horses, with their furniture, and one hundred rifles
and muskets, were carried off by Davie in safety without the
loss of a man. On August 5th an attack was ordered upon
Hanging Rock by Colonel Sumter, who commanded in person
the eight hundred troops engaged in the expedition. Of
these five hundred were North Carolinians, commanded by
Colonel Irwin and Major Davie. The troops halted at midnight
within two miles of the enemy's camp, which they attacked
next morning at daylight. The British regulars were
commanded by Major Carden, while among the auxiliaries
were several Tory regiments. One was composed of Tories
from the upper Yadkin, commanded by Colonel Bryan (whom
Davie afterwards defended when tried for treason at Salisbury),
and another, mostly of South Carolinians, was led by
Colonel John Hamilton, of Halifax, who for many years
after the war was British Consul at Norfolk. The attack
at first was completely successful, but from lack of discipline
many of the troops plundered the camps and became
intoxicated. A part of the British troops remaining intact,
formed a hollow square and necessitated a retreat, which, however,
was made in good order, Davie's corps covering the
rear. The wounded were safely convoyed by him to Charlotte,
where, by his foresight, a hospital had been established.
It is worthy of note that on this march to the attack at Hanging
Rock, by Davie's side rode, as guides conversant with
the roads and of undoubted courage and patriotism, two
country lads, brothers, respectively aged thirteen and fifteen
years. The younger of the two was destined to see many
another field of carnage, and his name has filled long and well
the sounding trump of fame&mdash;Andrew Jackson. Long years
after, in the retirement of the Hermitage, he said that Davie
was the best soldier he had ever known and that his best
lessons in the art of war had been learned from him.</p>

<p>On Davie's return from Charlotte he hastened to the general
rendezvous of Gates' army at Rugely's Mills. On
August 16th, while proceeding to join General Gates at Camden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and ten miles from the battle-field, Major Davie met the
defeated army with the General leading the retreat. He
ordered Davie to fall back on Charlotte, but he replied that
his men had formed the acquaintance of Tarleton's Legion
and did not fear to meet them again. He continued his
course towards the battle-ground, meeting the flying fragments
of the routed army. He secured several wagons loaded
with clothing and medicine, which had been abandoned.
With characteristic thoughtfulness he immediately sent an
officer to notify Colonel Sumter of the great disaster which
had befallen our arms. He reached Sumter that evening,
who at once began his retreat along the west bank of the
Catawba, towards the up-country. Not taking sufficient precaution,
however, Sumter was surprised on the 18th by Tarleton
at Fishing Creek, and his entire command of eight hundred
men was captured or put to flight with the loss of all
his artillery, arms, and baggage. Colonel Sumter himself,
who was asleep under a wagon when the attack was made,
barely escaped, and the next day reached Davie's camp at
Charlotte alone, riding on horseback, without saddle or
bridle. The tidings carried consternation into the fragments
of Gates' army which had rallied there, and in a few moments
Davie and his command were the only force left in
front of the enemy. Instead of retiring, he boldly advanced
to the Waxhaws, and found that the enemy had fallen back
to Camden.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, 1780, Davie was appointed by
Governor Nash Colonel Commandant of Cavalry in the Western
District of North Carolina, with instructions to raise a
regiment. When he had collected only about seventy men,
with that force and two small companies of riflemen, commanded
by Major George Davidson, he took post at Providence,
twenty-five miles from the British camp. Cornwallis,
after resting at Camden till the first week in September, had
advanced to the Waxhaws, forty miles below Charlotte, while
the fragments of the American army were slowly gathering
at Hillsborough, two hundred miles distant. South Carolina
was wholly subjugated, and North Carolina had not recovered
from the shock of Gates' defeat. Under these circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Colonel Davie, with unprecedented boldness, with a command
not exceeding one hundred and fifty men all told, on the
20th of September, turning the right flank of the British
army by a circuitous march, fell upon three or four hundred
of the enemy at Wahab's plantation. The attack was made at
daylight. The surprise was complete.</p>

<p>The enemy left fifteen or twenty dead on the field and
had some forty wounded. Davie got off safely with the captured
horses and had only one man wounded. The enemy
at once caused the farm buildings which belonged to Captain
Wahab, then a volunteer with Davie, to be laid in ashes.
Davie brought off ninety-six horses and their furniture and one
hundred and twenty stand of arms, and arrived in camp the
same afternoon, having marched sixty miles in less than
twenty-four hours, including the time employed in seeking
and beating the enemy. That evening Generals Sumner and
Davidson arrived at his camp with their force of one thousand
badly equipped militia.</p>

<p>On the 24th of September the American patrols gave notice
that the force of the enemy was in motion on the Steele
Creek road, leading to Charlotte. Generals Sumner and
Davidson retreated by Phifer's on the nearest road to Salisbury.
Colonel Davie, with one hundred and fifty mounted
men and some volunteers under Major Joseph Graham, was
left alone in front of the British army, and he was ordered to
observe the enemy and skirmish with his advance. On the
afternoon and night of the 25th he took a number of prisoners,
and at midnight took up his position at Charlotte, seven
miles from the spot where Earl Cornwallis had encamped.
Early on the 26th his patrols were driven in by the enemy's
light troops, and in a few moments the Legion and light infantry
were seen advancing, followed by the whole army.
Charlotte was then a village of about twenty houses, built
on two streets which crossed each other at right angles. At
their intersection stood the court-house. Colonel Davie dismounted
one company and stationed it under the court-house,
where they were protected by a stone wall. The other two
companies were advanced about eighty yards and posted behind
some houses and gardens. The Legion formed at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
distance of three hundred yards with a front to fill the
street. On sounding the charge the enemy's cavalry advanced
at full gallop, but at sixty yards from the court-house
the Americans opened fire and drove them back with great
precipitation. A second and third charge had the same result,
but being outflanked by the Legion infantry, Davie
withdrew his companies in good order, they successively covering
each other, and retreated on the Salisbury road. The
enemy followed with great caution and respect for some distance,
when they at length ventured to charge the small rear
guard. In this charge Lieutenant Locks and four privates
were killed and Major Graham and five privates wounded.
The coolness and skill of Davie in this ever-memorable combat,
in which, with a mere handful of men, he held the whole
British army for hours at bay and drove back repeatedly its
best troops and finally brought off his command unbroken
and in good order, stamp him as a soldier of no ordinary capacity.
He was at this time twenty-four years of age. Governor
Graham says of him: "He was prudent, vigilant, intrepid,
and skillful in his movements against the enemy, and
with a charming presence, a ready eloquence, and an undaunted
spirit, he was among the young men of the day as
was Harry Percy to the chivalry of England." He also
terms him "one of the most accomplished and elegant gentlemen
of the Revolutionary race." Besides his abilities as a
leader he was an expert swordsman. It is said in <cite>Garden's
Anecdotes of the Revolutionary War</cite>, that he had slain
more men in personal encounters in battle than any man in
the army.</p>

<p>The next day, after the brilliant affair at Charlotte, Colonel
Davie joined the army at Salisbury, where, recruits having
come in and Colonel Taylor from Granville having joined
him, his force consisted of three hundred mounted infantry
and a few dragoons. Generals Sumner and Davidson continued
their retreat across the Yadkin, while Davie returned
towards Charlotte, where he so vexed the British by cutting
off the foraging parties and beating up their advanced posts
that Cornwallis began to feel great distress for want of forage
and supplies. (<cite>Tarleton's Campaigns</cite>, p. 184). The British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
officer declared he had "found a rebel in every bush outside
his encampment." On October 7th occurred the disastrous
defeat of Ferguson at King's Mountain, and on the
night of October 14th, Cornwallis began his retreat to South
Carolina, followed by Davie, who harassed his rear and captured
part of his baggage. On the 19th the British crossed
the Catawba at Land's Ford and completely evacuated the
State of North Carolina. When General Greene took command
of the Southern Army in December, 1780, he and
Colonel Davie met for the first time. The commissary department
became vacant by the resignation of Colonel Thomas
Polk. The subsistence of the army had become very difficult,
and Colonel Polk declared that it had become impossible.
General Greene having formed a high estimate of
Colonel Davie's abilities, earnestly, and in most flattering
terms, solicited him to relinquish his hopes of brilliant service
in the field and accept the vacant office. At the call of
patriotism he abandoned the tempting career which lay before
him and assumed the not less important but more unpleasant
and arduous duties of a station which offered no distinctions.
General Greene had himself set the example, having relinquished
a brilliant career in the field to assume for years the
duties of Quartermaster-General of the army. Colonel Davie
assumed the duties of his new post in January, 1781, and continued
with the army for the next five months. Hardly any
combination of circumstances could exist presenting greater
difficulties to the commissary of an army than those under
which he began. With a depreciated, almost worthless, currency
and an exhausted country, his only resource was to
receive from the willing and extort from the reluctant such
means of subsistence as they possessed, a service requiring
promptness and vigor among the disaffected and skill and
discretion among the friendly. These duties were well performed,
and, while they make no display on the page of history,
their efficient discharge was more really useful to the
cause and contributed more to the success of the army than
the most brilliant services of the most brilliant officer in
the field. In that capacity he was present in the memorable
battle at Guilford Court House. Though he had, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
course, no command, he was a watchful observer of all the
movements of the fight and distinguished himself by his
efforts to rally the broken ranks and bring them again into the
field. After Judge Schenck's vivid description of this battle
it would be a twice-told tale to recount its incidents. It may
be well to recall, however, that Eaton's Brigade was composed
of men from Warren, Franklin, Nash, Halifax, and Northampton
counties, while Butler's men were from the present
counties of Wake, Durham, Orange, Alamance, Vance, Granville,
Person, and Caswell. No race of people has changed
less by infiltration of foreign immigration. It is in warp and
woof the same it was a hundred years ago. Those who know
them well, know that they are "the blue hen's own chickens,"
and it is not to be believed (if all other proof was wanting) that
men of that stock ever left any fair field of fight in a body
save in honor.</p>

<p>It was here that Colonel Davie, seeing the veteran First
Maryland permit the enemy to approach to close quarters
while it remained apparently inert and impassive, exclaimed
with great emotion, "Great God! is it possible Colonel Gunby
will surrender himself and his whole regiment to the British?"
He had scarce spoken when, the command having
been given, their fire, like a sheet of flame, swept off the
enemy's first line. This was followed up by a bayonet charge
from Gunby. The hostile lines became so intermingled and
the moment so critical that Cornwallis, to save himself, caused
his cannon to open upon the mass of struggling men and
swept off friend and foe alike. This he did against the remonstrance
of General O'Hara, who was lying wounded on
the ground, and whose men were thus being destroyed at
short range by the cannon of their own army.</p>

<p>Colonel Davie continued with the army and was present at
Hobkirk's Hill on April 25th, and also at the evacuation of
Camden and the siege of Ninety-Six. While the army lay before
Ninety-Six, General Greene found it necessary to send
him as a confidential messenger to the Legislature of North
Carolina to represent to that body the wants of his army, and
that his almost sole reliance for assistance was on them. Colonel
Davie's knowledge of the members and his tact were such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that he procured a most generous contribution from the General
Assembly of men and supplies. The exigencies of the
service and the equipment of the new levies required him to
remain in North Carolina, and in July, 1781, he entered on
his duties as Commissary-General of this State, which post he
filled till the end of the war. The finances of the State were
in a desperate condition, and the country was well-nigh exhausted
by the requisitions of both hostile and friendly armies,
and, besides, supplies had to be dispatched to our troops operating
in South Carolina. No duties could be more arduous
or more admirably performed than those which fell to Colonel
Davie's lot at this stage of the war. Transportation was
lacking even for the supplies which could be obtained. The
future seemed uncertain as to everything. No post could
more sorely have tried the patience of any man. It argues
great versatility of talents that the brilliant cavalry officer
should execute with patience the duties of such a station, and
it required a rare self-denial to lay aside the opportunities of
distinction for the humdrum exactions of his wearying post.
To add to other troubles, he had to deal, during the year 1781,
with three different Governors of entirely different views and
dispositions. Governor Nash had resigned in disgust at the
proceedings of the Legislature; Governor Burke had been
taken prisoner, and Governor Martin completed the year. So
feeble at times was the support of the government that some
of the most pressing supplies were procured by Davie on his
own credit. Complex and numerous as were his accounts,
when he laid down his office he invited the severest legislative
scrutiny, but no objection to them could be found.</p>

<p>The war being over, Colonel Davie resumed the practice
of his profession in February, 1783. About the same time
he married Miss Sarah Jones, the daughter of General Allen
Jones, of Northampton, a niece of Willie Jones, and settled
in the town of Halifax, which place he made his future
residence. It was at that time practically the capital of
the State. The sessions of the General Assembly had been
frequently held at that place, and it was there that most
of the executive business of the State was transacted. He
was a brilliant advocate and possessed a natural aptitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for the practice of law. The State at that time was divided
into seven judicial districts: Halifax, New Bern, Wilmington,
Edenton, Hillsboro, Salisbury, and Morganton. To
these, in 1787, Fayetteville was added. The Superior
Courts were held only at these places, and not as now at a
court-house in each county. Colonel Davie took the circuit
and attended in turn all the Superior Courts of the State,
except that held at Morganton. He soon commanded a leading
practice in all these courts. At some places and at some
terms the dockets show that he appeared without exception
on one side or the other of every civil case. His practice
was very lucrative and he quickly accumulated a large estate.
An examination of our published Reports shows numerous
cases of importance in which he was counsel. Probably
the most important were <i>Hamilton</i> vs. <i>Eaton</i>, 1 N. C., 84,
which held the State Confiscation Act repealed by the United
States treaty of peace with England, and <i>Bayard</i> vs. <i>Singleton</i>,
1 N. C., 42, the first case in America which asserted
the power and duty of the courts to declare an act of the
Legislature unconstitutional. It also held the confiscation
acts against the late Tories invalid. Iredell, Johnston, and
Davie appeared for the successful plaintiff and Moore and
Nash for the defendant.</p>

<p>With the chivalry of his nature, it was most natural that
when the Tory, Colonel Bryan, with whom he had so often
crossed swords, was arraigned and tried at Salisbury, in 1782,
for treason, Colonel Davie was one of the counsel who conducted
his defense. In this he displayed a courage of the
forum no less brilliant and commendable than his conduct in
the field. Indeed Davie, though the youngest, became in
fact the principal counsel. Excitement ran so high that no
lesser favorite than "the hero of Charlotte" could command
attention. Bryan was convicted with several others, and was
sentenced to be hanged the 14th of April, 1782, but was pardoned
and exchanged. Judge Murphy, who had the opportunity
of judging, and whose opinion is of high value, says:
"Davie took Lord Bolingbroke for his model, and applied
himself with so much diligence to the study of his master that
literary men could easily recognize his lofty and flowing style.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
He was a tall, elegant man in his person; graceful and commanding
in his manners. His voice was mellow and adapted
to the expression of every passion. His style was magnificent
and flowing. He had a greatness of manner in public speaking
which suited his style and gave his speeches an imposing
effect. He was a laborious student and arranged his discourses
with care, and, when the subject suited his genius, poured
forth a torrent of eloquence that astonished and delighted his
audience. They looked upon him with delight, listened to his
long, harmonious periods, caught his emotions, and indulged
that ecstasy of feeling which fine speaking and powerful eloquence
can alone produce. He is certainly to be ranked
among the first orators whom the American nation has produced."
It is said of him, with probably small exaggeration,
that during fifteen years while he was at the bar there was not
a capital trial in North Carolina in which he was not retained
for the defense. Eminent as he was, it was not for the lack of
worthy competitors. James Iredell and Alfred Moore, successively
Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States,
François Xavier Martin, afterwards Chief Justice of Louisiana,
and Judge John Haywood, afterwards of Tennessee, were
his contemporaries. His brief-books, some of which are still
in existence, are models of neatness and show a most careful
summary of the evidence and citation of authority in each
case. Among his law students were Governor and United
Stales Senator David Stone, Mr. Justice Daniel, of our Supreme
Court, and many others who became distinguished
men. Judge Daniel said that he was the best lawyer and
most accomplished man he had ever known. It is stated
of him, in comparison with his great legal rival, John Haywood,
that while the latter carefully prepared every point,
Davie would seize the strong points of the case and throw
his whole strength upon them. In this he seems to have
retained the experience and instincts of his soldier-life. As
a characteristic of his elegant tastes and attention to details
it is said that an examination of his correspondence shows
that his letters were invariably written upon gilt-edge paper.</p>

<p>When the Convention which formed our present Federal
Constitution was called to meet at Philadelphia in May, 1787,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
he was elected one of the delegates. The delegates were the
then Governor, Richard Caswell, ex-Governor Alexander
Martin, Richard Dobbs Spaight, who, like Davie, was subsequently
Governor, William Blount, afterwards United States
Senator, and Hugh Williamson, afterwards a member of Congress
and an historian. Governor Caswell did not attend.
Colonel Davie was the junior member of the delegation, being
then, notwithstanding his distinguished career as a soldier and
his high standing at the bar, not yet thirty-one years of age.
Still his eloquence and influence made a decided impression
upon the Convention. The Constitution all through is the
result of compromise; but the critical question was the equal
representation of each State in the Senate. Upon this it
seemed likely the Convention would be dissolved. The large
States were firm for proportional representation. With the
smaller States an equal voice in the Senate was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>.
On that question North Carolina voted with the other large
States against the demands of the smaller States, and this
made the vote a tie, as Georgia, on purpose, evenly divided
her vote. The friends of the Constitution, fearing a disruption,
referred the question to a committee composed of one
from each State. Davie was the member of the committee
from North Carolina. When the committee made its report,
Davie, acting for North Carolina, gave her vote with the
smaller States, and thus, by one majority, was equal representation
in the Senate secured. Without it the Convention
would doubtless have adjourned after a useless session. The
Constitution, without that wise concession, could not have
been adopted, and if adopted by the Convention, its ratification
by the smaller States could not have been expected.
This act was certainly against the wishes of his own State,
then the third, in point of population, in the Confederation,
ranking next after Virginia and Massachusetts and ahead of
New York. It was also apparently against the interests of
his State, but the act was that of a statesman, and should be
recalled to his lasting honor. It was a critical moment, for
a narrow-minded man in his place, timid of responsibility and
fearful of his own popularity at home, would have prevented
or postponed for many years the American Union. He remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in Philadelphia till the deliberations of the Convention
were virtually over and the adoption of the Constitution
had become certain. Then, in obedience to his duty to his
clients, as the fall circuit was about to begin, he left for home.
Hence it is that his name does not appear among those appended
to that instrument. The Constitution being the work
of many hands and containing so many alterations and amendments,
would naturally have been rough and ill-joined, containing
a variety of styles. It is worthy of note that the Convention
considerately referred it to a committee of one&mdash;Gouverneur
Morris&mdash;an accomplished scholar, to make
changes "of form, not of substance." Under his hand it was
polished and put in shape, and hence the uniform flow and
regularity of its language.</p>

<p>But the work was not yet done. The Constitution was yet
to be ratified by the conventions of the several States. When
the North Carolina Convention met at Hillsborough, July 21,
1788, a formidable opposition was arrayed against its adoption,
headed by Willie Jones, David Caldwell, Judge Spencer,
and others. The friends of adoption were led by James Iredell,
a remarkably able man, and Colonel Davie, aided by
Spaight, Maclaine, Steele, and others. The adoption of the
Constitution was at that time defeated. After its subsequent
adoption by North Carolina, President Washington tendered
the appointment of United States District Judge to Davie,
who declined it. Colonel Stokes was appointed, but, soon
dying, John Sitgreaves was appointed, probably through
Davie's influence. He had married his wife's sister.</p>

<p>By his wife he had acquired a valuable plantation near
Halifax, which he took pleasure in cultivating, and he evinced
a deep interest in introducing there a better system of farming.
His enterprise and public spirit procured the organization
of a company for the proposed drainage of Lake Scuppernong.</p>

<p>A friend of education, in 1786 he obtained from the General
Assembly the charter of Warrenton Academy, and had
himself, with Willie Jones, Thomas Person, Benjamin Hawkins,
and other prominent men named as the board of trustees.
He was chosen repeatedly, except when his private business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
constrained him to decline an election, to represent the borough
of Halifax in the House of Commons. He served thus
in the years 1786, 1787, 1789, 1791, 1793, 1794, 1796, and
1798. He was the real founder of the University of North
Carolina, and is so styled in the journal of 1810 of that institution,
and well deserved to be so called. Judge Murphy
bears this testimony: "I was present in the House of Commons
when Davie addressed that body (in 1789) for a loan
of money to erect the buildings of the University, and, although
more than thirty years have elapsed, I have the most
vivid recollection of the greatness of his manner and the
power of his eloquence upon that occasion. In the House of
Commons he had no rival, and on all questions before that
body his eloquence was irresistible." He procured the act of
incorporation to be passed in 1789, and other aid, and was
always a fostering friend.</p>

<p>The opposition to all the measures in favor of the University
was great. The cry of "economy" and the fear expressed
that the institution was one step towards the founding
of an aristocracy made it difficult to carry any measure
through. Gifted with less tact, with less eloquence or with
less popularity, Davie must have failed. The institution is
no less a monument also to his public spirit, boldness, and
foresight. He was a member of the first board of trustees.
The selection of a site for the University, the superintendence
of the erection of the buildings, the choice of professors, the
arrangement of a course of studies, the adoption of regulations,
the maintenance of discipline engaged his personal and
active attention. Truly he might have exclaimed "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exegi
monumentum aere perennius</i>." The course of studies adopted
at Davie's instance in 1795 was the "optional" system which
now generally obtains. In this he anticipated the course of
other colleges full fifty years. When Dr. David Caldwell
was elected President this was set aside and the old iron-bound
curriculum was adopted and remained in force eighty years.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1787, in the town of Tarboro, the Free
Masons of this State organized the Grand Lodge of North
Carolina. At that meeting many of the most distinguished
men of the State attended, Colonel Davie among them. Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Johnston was elected the first Grand Master of North
Carolina, and Governor Caswell the second. Davie was
elected Grand Master in December, 1792, and was successively
reelected for seven years. In that capacity he laid the
cornerstone of the University, October 12, 1793 (the old
East Building), and on April 14, 1798, he laid the cornerstone
of the South Building at the same place.</p>

<p>The project of a digest of the laws was brought forward by
him, and the appointment of Judge Iredell, the accomplished
jurist, to do the work, was made at his suggestion. The cession
of the territory which now forms the State of Tennessee
was effected mainly by his influence. In 1791 he was appointed
by the Legislature one of the three commissioners to
establish the unsettled part of the boundary between this
State and South Carolina. He was again elected for the same
purpose in 1796, and again in 1803. None of these commissions,
however, were successful.</p>

<p>In 1794 he was commissioned by Governor Spaight to be
Major-General of the Third State Division, in view of the
likelihood of war with France. Congress, by the Act of
June 24, 1797, directed an embodiment of troops from the
several States. The number to be raised by this State under
the act was seven thousand two hundred and sixty-eight, and
in September of that year Davie was appointed by Governor
Ashe Major-General to command this detachment. As matters
became more serious, Congress, in May, 1798, authorized
a provisional army of the United States of ten thousand men,
and in this he was appointed a brigadier-general by President
Adams, July 17, 1798, and was confirmed by the Senate on
July 19th. Of this army Washington was made commander-in-chief,
and he, in effect, committed to General Davie the
selection of the officers for that part of the troops which should
be raised in this State. In the same year General Davie prepared
a system of cavalry tactics which was adopted by the
Legislature and ordered to be printed. A copy of this is now
in our State Library.</p>

<p>General Davie came out of the war with the first military
reputation in the State, and these successive appointments, so
many years after, prove that North Carolina still turned to
him as her greatest soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Just at this time, singularly enough, when in the receipt of
high honors, State and national, his election for the borough
of Halifax was first endangered. The circumstance is thus
stated in a private letter from that town, written in August,
1798: "The 'true whigs,' as they styled themselves, dined
together under the oaks and toasted Mr. Jefferson. The other
party, who were called 'aristocrats,' ate and drank in the
house on entirely different principles. General Davie dined in
the house with the 'aristocrats.' The 'true whigs' took offense
at this and resolved to oppose his election, and it was only
with much address that they were kept quiet." The writer
adds: "If any person had had the impudence to dispute the
election General Davie would certainly not have been returned.
The rabble, which in all places is the majority,
would have voted against him."</p>

<p>He took his seat when the Legislature met. By that body,
under the then constitutional mode, he was, on joint ballot,
elected Governor of the State on December 4th, 1798, over
Benjamin Williams (afterwards Governor), and was inaugurated
December 7th. Nothing of special note took place during
his tenure of office. President Adams appointed an embassy
to treat with the French Directory, consisting of Mr.
Murray, then our Minister to Holland, Chief Justice Ellsworth,
and Patrick Henry. The latter having declined on
the ground of age and ill health, Governor Davie was appointed
in his stead, June 1, 1799. On September 10th he
resigned the office of Governor, and on the 22nd, left Halifax
to join Mr. Ellsworth at Trenton. At his departure the
people of Halifax and vicinity presented him with a complimentary
address, which was written by a political adversary
and signed by large numbers of the same party.</p>

<p>On November 3, 1799, Messrs. Ellsworth and Davie embarked
in the frigate <i>United States</i>, from Newport, Rhode
Island. Aware of the changes constantly taking place in the
French government, they touched at Lisbon on the 27th of
November. They left on the 21st of December, but being
driven out of their course by a storm, they put into Corunna
the 11th of January, 1800, which they left by land on the
27th, and on February 9th, at Burgos, in Spain, they met
a courier from Talleyrand, the French Minister, inviting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
them, on the part of Bonaparte, who had become First
Consul, to proceed to Paris, which place they reached on
March 2d. These dates will show the vast difference which
less than a century has made in the modes of traveling and
the transmission of intelligence. On April 8th the Commissioners
were received with marked politeness by the First
Consul. Napoleon having left for Italy on the famous campaign
of Marengo, the negotiations dragged till his return.
On September 30, 1800, the treaty between the United States
and France was signed by our Commissioners and by Joseph
Bonaparte, Roederer, and Fleurieu, on the part of France.
The conclusion of the treaty was celebrated with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> at
Morfontaine (the country-seat of Joseph Bonaparte), the First
Consul and a brilliant staff attending. One who was then in
Paris writes: "A man of his (Davie's) imposing appearance
and dignified deportment could not fail to attract especial
attention and remark wherever he went. I could not but remark
that Bonaparte, in addressing the American legation at
his levees, seemed for the time to forget that Governor Davie
was <em>second</em> in the commission, his attention being more particularly
directed to him." In the brilliant circles of the nascent
empire of Napoleon he was distinguished by his elegance and
his popular manners. His sojourn in Paris was very agreeable
to him. He was an accomplished linguist and spoke
French and Spanish fluently.</p>

<p>In the fall of that year Governor Davie returned directly
home. It is significant that the very day after the treaty was
signed, France, by the treaty of St. Ildefonso, reacquired
Louisiana from Spain, which it so soon after sold to the United
States.</p>

<p>On his return home Davie was solicited to become a candidate
for Congress in 1801, but his private affairs, by reason
of his long absence, required his attention, and he declined.
Willis Alston, then a member of the same political party, was
elected. In June of that year President Jefferson appointed
Governor Davie head of a commission, with General Wilkinson
and Benjamin Hawkins, to negotiate with the Creeks and
other Indians for further cession of lands. This he declined
for the same reason that he had refused an election to Congress.
In 1802 he was appointed by President Jefferson a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
commissioner on the part of the United States in the treaty
to be made between North Carolina and the Tuscaroras, most
of whom had moved from this State, but had retained a valuable
landed interest in Bertie county. He met the agents of
the State and the chiefs of the Indians at Raleigh, and the
treaty was signed December 4th, 1802, by virtue of which
King Blount and the remainder of the tribe removed to New
York in June, 1803. In the spring of 1803, Alston having
gone over to the opposite political party, General Davie was
again solicited by his friends to become a candidate for Congress.
He accepted the nomination, but declined to make any
canvass. He was charged with being an aristocrat and with
being opposed to Mr. Jefferson, whose prestige was then all-powerful.
He was defeated at the polls.</p>

<p>He had lost his wife not long after his return from France.
This, together with his political defeat, determined him to
withdraw altogether from public life. In November, 1805,
he removed to an estate he possessed at Tivoli, near Landsford,
in South Carolina, just across the line from Mecklenburg
county in this State. Here he lived in dignified ease and
leisure.</p>

<p>Many men, after the bufferings of a stormy or a busy life,
have in like manner felt the need of rest before going hence.
It was thus that the Emperor Charles V., at Juste, and
Wolsey, who had "sounded all the depths and shoals of
honor," at Leicester Abbey, had sought to put a space of contemplation
between the active duties of life and the grave.
Davie's country, however, did not forget him. During the
second war with Great Britain, President Madison appointed
him a major-general in the United States army, and he was
confirmed by the Senate, March 2d, 1813. But "time steals
fire from the mind as vigor from the limbs." Though not an
old man, General Davie's early campaigns had told upon
him. The sword which twenty-five years before had almost
leapt of itself from the scabbard was now constrained to hang
idly by his side, and he declined the appointment. General
Harrison (afterwards President) was appointed in his stead
and fought the battle of the Thames, October 5, 1813 in
which Tecumseh was slain. The next year he in turn resigned
and General Andrew Jackson was appointed to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
him, and the battle of New Orleans followed on January 8,
1815.</p>

<p>General Davie's seat at Tivoli, on the Catawba, was the resort
of many of the Revolutionary characters. In their
journeys by private conveyance to Virginia or the North,
the custom was to arrange to spend a day or two there
with him, where he kept open house for his friends, and,
sitting under an immense oak, from which there was a view
of miles of the Catawba, they fought over the war together or
discussed the workings of the new government and the Constitution
they had established. This was all the more interesting,
as much of his campaigning had taken place on and
around this very spot. In this connection it is interesting to
state that after his retirement to Tivoli he was much sought
after in drawing wills. He drew some of the most famous
wills in that State&mdash;indeed, it is said, all of them in that part
in which he resided, not one of which, except his own, was
ever assailed. In this respect he had the fortune of Sugden
(Lord Saint Leonard's), Governor Tilden, and many other
famous lawyers. The contest over Governor Davie's will has
just been settled by a decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States, filed the 28th of March of this year (1892), in
the case of <i>Bedon</i> vs. <i>Davie</i>, 144 U. S., 142, a very interesting
case.</p>

<p>His correspondence and other materials for history must
have been very large and very valuable. It was from his
papers that the copy of the Mecklenburg Declaration of May
20th, 1775, was procured, which is known as the "Davie
Copy." Unfortunately all his family papers and all the historical
material which had been carefully preserved by him
for publication at some future time were destroyed during
Sherman's raid. The banks of the Catawba were said to have
been strewn with them, and nothing of the collection now
remains.</p>

<p>In retirement he displayed his accustomed public spirit by
introducing improved methods of farming, and mainly at his
instance a State Agricultural Society in South Carolina was
formed, of which he was the first president. By his practice
at the bar he had accumulated a large estate, which he dispensed
with liberality and hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>When the end came he met it with the firmness of a soldier.
His sun of life went down in a cloudless sky. He passed away
the 18th of November, 1820, in his sixty-fifth year.</p>

<p>He was buried at Waxhaw Church, Lancaster county,
South Carolina, just across the Catawba river from his Tivoli
plantation. The following modest and truthful inscription in

<p>The foregoing is the main body and more strictly biographical
part of an address delivered by Judge Clark, July 4th,
1892, at the celebration of the battle of Guilford Court
House, on the battle-field.</p>

<p>Davie's life has been written more at length by Prof. Fordyce
M. Hubbard and published in <cite>Sparks' American Biography</cite>;
but I have used Judge Clark's sketch, and have
slightly abbreviated it to suit the scope of my purpose.</p>

<p>I am reminded by Colonel Benehan Cameron, a member
of the North Carolina Publishing Society, that the lovers of
fine horses will be glad to have it noted here that General
Davie was once the owner of the celebrated "Sir Archie"&mdash;the
sire of American thoroughbreds&mdash;the Godolphin of the
American turf. Like all great commanders, Davie was a fine
judge of a horse; he readily paid five thousand dollars for
"Sir Archie" as a colt, and only parted from him in deference
to his friends, who urged him that such a price was very
extravagant. Davie's judgment, however, was abundantly
vindicated; for, many years afterwards, the commissioner of
the court found that the horse had been worth to the estate
of William Amis, his subsequent owner, the round sum of
eighty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Some idea may be gathered of the interest of the turfmen
in this great horse&mdash;the great-grandsire of "Lexington"&mdash;from
the fact that they are still disputing about the places of
his birth and death.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is, says Colonel Cameron, who
takes interest in this controversy, he was born at Carter Hall,
in Virginia, died in North Carolina, and was buried on the
"Mowfield" plantation of Colonel Amis in Northampton
county. The place of his burial is still pointed out by old
people, for human nature is loath to allow the memory of
great excellence to perish, even though exemplified in a dumb
beast. It is said that some years ago his bones were taken
up and carried to a museum in Philadelphia.</p>

<small>BY THOMAS H. BENTON</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>Philosophic in his temperament and wise in his conduct,
governed in all his actions by reason and judgment, and
deeply imbued with Bible images, this virtuous and patriotic
man (whom Mr. Jefferson called "the last of the Romans")
had long fixed the term of his political existence at the age
which the Psalmist assigns for the limit of manly life: "The
days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason
of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."
He touched that age in 1828; and, true to all his purposes,
he was true to his resolve in this, and executed it with the
quietude and indifference of an ordinary transaction. He
was in the middle of a third senatorial term, and in the full
possession of all his faculties of mind and body; but his time
for retirement had come&mdash;the time fixed by himself; but
fixed upon conviction and for well considered reasons, and as
inexorable to him as if fixed by fate. To the friends who
urged him to remain to the end of his term, and who insisted
that his mind was as good as ever, he would answer that it
was good enough yet to let him know that he ought to quit
office before his mind quit him, and that he did not mean to
risk the fate of the Archbishop of Grenada. He resigned his
senatorial honors as he had worn them&mdash;meekly, unostentatiously,
in a letter of thanks and gratitude to the General
Assembly of his State, and gave to repose at home that interval
of thought and quietude which every wise man would
wish to place between the turmoil of strife and the stillness of
eternity. He had nine years of this tranquil enjoyment, and
died without pain or suffering, June 29, 1837&mdash;characteristic
in death as in life. It was eight o'clock in the morning when
he felt that the supreme hour had come, had himself full-dressed
with his habitual neatness, walked in the room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lay upon the bed, by turns conversing kindly with those
who were about him, and showing by his conduct that he
was ready and waiting, but hurrying nothing. It was the
death of Socrates, all but the hemlock, and in that full faith
of which the Grecian sage had only a glimmering. He
directed his own grave on a point of sterile ridge (where nobody
would wish to plough), and covered with a pile of rough
flint-stone (which nobody would wish to build with), deeming
this sterility and the uselessness of this rock the best security
for that undisturbed repose of the bones which is still desirable
to those who are indifferent to monuments.</p>

<p>In almost all strongly marked characters there is usually
some incident or sign, in early life, which shows that character
and reveals to the close observer the type of the future
man. So it was with Mr. Macon. His firmness, his patriotism,
his self-denial, his devotion to duty, and disregard of office
and emolument; his modesty, integrity, self-control, and subjection
of conduct to the convictions of reason and the dictates
of virtue, all so steadily exemplified in a long life, were
all shown from the early age of eighteen, in the miniature
representation of individual action, and only confirmed in the
subsequent public exhibitions of a long, beautiful, and exalted
career.</p>

<p>He was of that age, and a student at Princeton College, at
the time of the Declaration of American Independence. A
small volunteer corps was then on the Delaware. He quit his
books, joined it, served a term, returned to Princeton, and resumed
his studies. In the year 1778 the Southern States had
become a battle-field, big with their own fate, and possibly involving
the issue of the war. British fleets and armies appeared
there, strongly supported by the friends of the British
cause; and the conquest of the South was fully counted upon.
Help was needed in these States; and Mr. Macon, quitting
college, returned to his native county in North Carolina,
joined a militia company as a private, and marched to South
Carolina&mdash;then the theatre of the enemy's operations. He
had his share in all the hardships and disasters of that trying
time; was at the fall of Fort Moultrie, surrender of Charleston,
defeat at Camden, and in the rapid winter retreat across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the upper part of North Carolina. He was in the camp on
the left bank of the Yadkin when the sudden flooding of that
river, in the brief interval between the crossing of the Americans
and the coming up of the British, arrested the pursuit of
Cornwallis and enabled Greene to allow some rest to his
wearied and exhausted men. In this camp, destitute of everything
and with gloomy prospects ahead, a summons came to
Mr. Macon from the Governor of North Carolina, requiring
him to attend a meeting of the General Assembly, of which
he had been elected a member, without his knowledge, by the
people of his county. He refused to go, and the incident
being talked of through the camp, came to the knowledge of
the general. Greene was a <em>man</em> himself and able to know
a <em>man</em>. He felt at once that, if this report was true, this
young soldier was no common character, and determined to
verify the fact. He sent for the young man, inquired of him,
heard the truth, and then asked for the reason of this unexpected
conduct&mdash;this preference for a suffering camp over
a comfortable seat in the General Assembly. Mr. Macon
answered him, in his quaint and sententious way, that he had
seen the <em>faces</em> of the British many times, but had never seen
their <em>backs</em>, and meant to stay in the army till he did. Greene
instantly saw the material the young man was made of and
the handle by which he was to be worked. That material
was patriotism, that handle a sense of duty; and laying hold
of this handle, he quickly worked the young soldier into a
different conclusion from the one that he had arrived at.
He told him he could do more good as a member of the
General Assembly than as a soldier; that in the army he was
but one man, and in the General Assembly he might obtain
many, with the supplies they needed, by showing the destitution
and suffering which he had seen in the camp; and that
it was his duty to go. This view of duty and usefulness was
decisive. Mr. Macon obeyed the Governor's summons, and
by his representations contributed to obtain the supplier which
enabled Greene to turn back and face Cornwallis&mdash;fight him,
cripple him, drive him further back than he had advanced
(for Wilmington is south of Camden), disable him from remaining
in the South (of which, up to the battle of Guilford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
he believed himself to be master), and sending him to Yorktown,
where he was captured and the war ended.</p>

<p>The philosophy of history has not yet laid hold of the battle
of Guilford, its consequences and effects. That battle made
the capture of Yorktown. The events are told in every history:
their connection and dependence in none. It broke up
the plan of Cornwallis in the South, and changed the plan of
Washington in the North. Cornwallis was to subdue the
Southern States, and was doing it until Greene turned upon
him at Guilford. Washington was occupied with Sir Henry
Clinton, then in New York with twelve thousand British
troops. He had formed the heroic design to capture Clinton
and his army (the French fleet cooperating) in that city, and
thereby putting an end to the war. All his preparations were
going on for that grand consummation when he got news of
the battle of Guilford, the retreat of Cornwallis to Wilmington,
his inability to keep the field in the South, and his return
northward through the lower part of Virginia. He saw
his advantage&mdash;an easier prey&mdash;and the same result, if successful.
Cornwallis or Clinton, either of them captured,
would put an end to the war. Washington changed his plan,
deceived Clinton, moved rapidly upon the weaker general,
captured him and his seven thousand men, and ended the
Revolutionary war. The battle of Guilford put that capture
into Washington's hands; and thus Guilford and Yorktown
became connected; and the philosophy of history shows
their dependence, and that the lesser event was father to the
greater. The State of North Carolina gave General Greene
twenty-five thousand acres of western land for that day's
work, now worth a million of dollars; but the day itself has
not yet obtained its proper place in American history.</p>

<p>The military life of Mr. Macon finished with his departure
from the camp on the Yadkin, and his civil public life commenced
on his arrival at the General Assembly, to which he
had been summoned&mdash;that civil public life in which he was
continued above forty years by free elections&mdash;Representative
in Congress under Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison,
and long the Speaker of the House; Senator in Congress
under Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams; and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
elected President of the Senate, and until voluntarily declining;
twice refusing to be Postmaster-General under Jefferson;
never taking any office but that to which he was elected; and
resigning his last senatorial term when it was only half run.
But a characteristic trait remains to be told of his military
life&mdash;one that has neither precedent nor imitation (the example
of Washington being out of the line of comparison):
he refused to receive pay or to accept promotion, and served
three years as a private through mere devotion to his country.
And all the long length of his life was conformable to this
patriotic and disinterested beginning: and thus the patriotic
principles of the future Senator were all revealed in early life
and in the obscurity of an unknown situation. Conformably
to this beginning, he refused to take anything under the modern
acts of Congress for the benefit of the surviving officers
and soldiers of the Revolution, and voted against them all,
saying they had suffered alike (citizens and military), and all
been rewarded together in the establishment of independence;
that the debt to the army had been settled by pay, by pensions
to the wounded, by half-pay and land to the officers:
that no military claim could be founded on depreciated continental
paper money, from which the civil functionaries who
performed service, and farmers who furnished supplies, suffered
as much as any. On this principle he voted against the
bill for Lafayette, against all the modern Revolutionary pensions
and land bounty acts, and refused to take anything
under them (for many were applicable to himself).</p>

<p>His political principles were deep-rooted, innate, subject to
no change and to no machinery of party. He was democratic
in the broad sense of the word, as signifying a capacity in the
people for self-government; and in its party sense, as in favor
of a plain and economical administration of the Federal Government,
and against latitudinarian constructions of the Constitution.
He was a party man, not in the hackneyed sense
of the word, but only where principle was concerned; and was
independent of party in all his social relations, and in all the
proceedings which he disapproved. Of this he gave a strong
instance in the case of General Hamilton, whom he deemed
honorable and patriotic; and utterly refused to be concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in a movement proposed to affect him personally, though politically
opposed to him. He venerated Washington, admired
the varied abilities and high qualities of Hamilton, and
esteemed and respected the eminent Federal gentlemen of his
time. He had affectionate regard for Madison and Monroe;
but Mr. Jefferson was to him the full and perfect exemplification
of the republican statesman. His almost fifty years of
personal and political friendship and association with Mr.
Randolph is historical, and indissolubly connects their names
and memories in the recollection of their friends, and in history,
if it does them justice. He was the early friend of
General Jackson, and intimate with him when he was a Senator
in Congress under the administration of the elder Mr.
Adams; and was able to tell Congress and the world who he
was when he began to astonish Europe and America by his
victories. He was the kind observer of the conduct of young
men, encouraging them by judicious commendation when he
saw them making efforts to become useful and respectable,
and never noting their faults. He was just in all things, and
in that most difficult of all things, judging political opponents,
to whom he would do no wrong, not merely in word or
act, but in thought. He spoke frequently in Congress,
always to the point, and briefly and wisely; and was one of
those speakers whom Mr. Jefferson described Dr. Franklin to
have been&mdash;a speaker of no pretension and great performance,
who spoke more good sense while he was getting up
out of his chair, and getting back into it, than many others
did in long discourses; and he suffered no reporter to dress up
a speech for him.</p>

<p>He was above the pursuit of wealth, but also above dependence
and idleness; and, like an old Roman of the elder
Cato's time, worked in the fields at the head of his slaves in
the intervals of public duty, and did not cease this labor until
advancing age rendered him unable to stand the hot sun of
summer&mdash;the only season of the year when senatorial duties
left him at liberty to follow the plough or handle the hoe.
I think it was the summer of 1817&mdash;that was the last time
(he told me) he tried it, and found the sun too hot for him&mdash;then
sixty years of age, a Senator, and the refuser of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
office. How often I think of him when I see at Washington
robustious men going through a scene of supplication, tribulation,
and degradation, to obtain office, which the salvation
of the soul does not impose upon the vilest sinner. His
fields, his flocks and his herds yielded an ample supply of
domestic productions. A small crop of tobacco&mdash;three hogsheads
when the season was good, two when bad&mdash;purchased
the exotics which comfort and necessity required and which
the farm did not produce. He was not rich, but rich enough
to dispense hospitality and charity, to receive all guests in his
house, from the President to the day-laborer&mdash;no other title
being necessary to enter his house but that of an honest man;
rich enough to bring up his family (two daughters) as accomplished
ladies, and marry them to accomplished gentlemen&mdash;one
to William Martin, Esq., and the other to William
Eaton, Esq., of Roanoke, my early schoolfellow and friend
for more than half a century; and, above all, he was rich
enough to pay as he went and never to owe a dollar to any
man.</p>

<p>He was steadfast in his friendships and would stake himself
for a friend, but would violate no point of public duty to
please or oblige him. Of this his relations with Mr. Randolph
gave a signal instance. He drew a knife to defend him in the
theatre at Philadelphia, when menaced by some naval and
military officers for words spoken in debate and deemed offensive
to their professions; yet, when Speaker of the House of
Representatives, he displaced Mr. Randolph from the head of
the Committee of Ways and Means because the chairman of
that committee should be on terms of political friendship with
the administration&mdash;which Mr. Randolph had then ceased to
be with Mr. Jefferson's. He was above executive office, even
the highest the President could give; but not above the lowest
the people could give, taking that of justice of the peace in
his county, and refusing that of Postmaster-General at Washington.
He was opposed to nepotism, and to all quartering
of his connections on the government; and in the course of
his forty-years' service, with the absolute friendship of many
administrations and the perfect respect of all, he never had
office or contract for any of his blood. He refused to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
candidate for the Vice-Presidency, but took the place of Elector
on the Van Buren ticket in 1836. He was against paper
money and the paper system, and was accustomed to present
the strong argument against both, in the simple phrase that
this was a hard-money government, made by hard-money
men, who had seen the evil of paper money and meant to
save their posterity from it. He was opposed to security-ships,
and held that no man ought to be entangled in the
affairs of another, and that the interested parties alone&mdash;those
who expected to find their profit in the transaction&mdash;should
bear the bad consequences, as well as enjoy the good
ones, of their own dealings. He never called any one
"friend" without being so, and never expressed faith in the
honor and integrity of a man without acting up to the declaration
when the occasion required it. Thus, in constituting his
friend, Weldon N. Edwards, Esq., his testamentary and sole
executor, with large discretionary powers, he left all to his
honor, and forbade him to account to any court or power for
the manner in which he should execute that trust. This prohibition
was so characteristic, and so honorable to both parties,
and has been so well justified by the event, that I give it in
his own words, as copied from his will, to-wit:</p>

<p>"I subjoin the following, in my own handwriting, as a
codicil to this my last will and testament, and direct that it
be a part thereof&mdash;that is to say, having full faith in the
honor and integrity of my executor above named, he shall
not be held to account to any court or power whatever for the
discharge of the trust confided by me to him in and by the
foregoing will."</p>

<p>And the event has proved that his judgment, as always,
committed no mistake when it bestowed that confidence. He
had his peculiarities&mdash;idiosyncrasies, if any one pleases&mdash;but
they were born with him, suited to him, constituting a part
of his character, and necessary to its completeness. He never
subscribed to charities, but gave, and freely, according to his
means&mdash;the left hand not knowing what the right hand did.
He never subscribed for new books, giving as a reason to the
soliciting agent that nobody purchased his tobacco until it
was inspected, and he could buy no book until he had examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it. He would not attend the Congress Presidential Caucus
of 1824, although it was sure to nominate his own
choice (Mr. Crawford); and, when a reason was wanted, he
gave it in the brief answer that he attended one once and
they cheated him, and he had said that he would never
attend another. He always wore the same dress&mdash;that is to
say, a suit of the same material, cut, and color superfine navy
blue&mdash;the whole suit from the same piece, and in the fashion
of the time of the Revolution; and always replaced by a new
one before it showed age. He was neat in his person, always
wore fine linen, a fine cambric stock, a fine fur hat with a
brim to it, fair top-boots&mdash;the boot outside the pantaloons, on
the principle that leather was stronger than cloth. He would
wear no man's honors, and when complimented on the report
on the Panama mission, which, as Chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, he had presented to the Senate,
he would answer, "Yes, it is a good report; Tazewell wrote
it." Left to himself, he was ready to take the last place and
the lowest seat anywhere; but, in his representative capacity
he would suffer no derogation of a constitutional or of a popular
right. Thus, when Speaker of the House, and a place
behind the President's Secretaries had been assigned him in
some ceremony, he disregarded the programme, and, as the
elect of the elect of all the people, took his place next after
those whom the national vote had elected. And in 1803, on
the question to change the form of voting for President and
Vice-President, and the vote wanting one of the constitutional
number of two-thirds, he resisted the rule of the House
which restricted the Speaker's vote to a tie, or to a vote which
would make a tie&mdash;claimed his constitutional right to vote as
a member, obtained it, gave the vote, made the two-thirds,
and carried the amendment.</p>

<p>And, what may well be deemed idiosyncratic in these days,
he was punctual in the performance of all his minor duties to
the Senate, attending its sittings to the moment, attending all
the committees to which he was appointed, attending all the
funerals of the members and officers of the Houses, always in
time at every place where duty required him; and refusing
double mileage for one traveling when elected from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
House of Representatives to the Senate or summoned to an
extra session. He was an habitual reader and student of the
Bible, a pious and religious man, and of the "<em>Baptist persuasion</em>,"
as he was accustomed to express it.</p>

<p>I have a pleasure in recalling the recollections of this wise,
just and good man, and in writing them down, not without
profit, I hope, to rising generations, and at least as extending
the knowledge of the kind of men to whom we are indebted
for our independence and for the form of government which
they established for us. Mr. Macon was the real Cincinnatus
of America, the pride and ornament of my native State, my
hereditary friend through four generations, my mentor in the
first seven years of my senatorial, and the last seven of his
senatorial life; and a feeling of gratitude and of filial affection
mingles itself with this discharge of historical duty to his
memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Benton called his sketch, which appears in his <cite>Thirty-years'
View</cite>, "Retiring of Mr. Macon." It is well done, and
interesting also because it is what one great man said of another.
Yet I confess with some mortification that I have
never seen it in print in North Carolina except in Benton's
book.</p>

<p>To the foregoing admirable sketch by Benton I subjoin the
following copious extracts from the <cite>Memoir of Nathaniel
Macon</cite> by Weldon N. Edwards, published in July, 1862:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nathaniel Macon was born on the 17th of December, 1758,
in the county of Bute, of the then province of North Carolina,
in the part of it now Warren, within a few miles of the
present village of Warrenton, of poor and respectable parents.
His great-grandfather was a Huguenot and came over from
France to escape the persecutions consequent upon the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, in 1685. His father, Gideon
H. Macon, was born in Virginia, whence he came to North
Carolina. His mother was a native of North Carolina and a
daughter of Edward Jones, of Shocco. He lost his father in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
early boyhood, and was left, with many brothers and sisters,
in the care of his widowed mother, with such moderate means
of support as to require the utmost care and industry to get
on even tolerably in the world. He assisted in all the domestic
offices and labors common with boys at that day. He acquired
the rudiments of education in the neighborhood, at
what was called an "old-field school." The application, progress,
and good habits of the boy gave such promise of the future
man that it was resolved to make every effort to give him a
thorough education, and he was accordingly sent to Princeton
College, New Jersey. His own inclinations eagerly seconded
the hopeful purpose of his friends. While there, he prosecuted
his studies with fond diligence, and sought all the avenues
to useful knowledge with unflagging zeal. Nor did he
relax his efforts in this respect after his return home, devoting
to such books as were within his reach all the time he
could spare from the ordinary duties of life; but he met with
great difficulties, owing to the scarcity of books and his own
poverty. In the latter part of his life he was often heard to
say that his eyesight failed him sooner than it otherwise would
have done, in consequence of his reading so much by firelight
in his youth and early manhood, being then too poor to buy
candles, his small patrimony having been exhausted during
his minority in his support and education.</p>

<p>His love for North Carolina was sincere and thorough. In
all that concerned her character, her institutions, her welfare,
he felt an ever-wakeful solicitude. Although he received
his collegiate education in a distant State, he ever after
gave a decided preference to the seminaries of his own loved
North Carolina. When his son-in-law, William Eaton, Sr.,
in the year 1823 was about to send two of his sons to Cambridge,
he dissuaded him from it and advised him to send
them to the University of North Carolina, because, among
other reasons, they would there make acquaintances of many
of the future men of the State, and contract friendships that
would be of service to them in the part they were destined to
act in the great drama of life.</p>

<p>He studied law, but never applied for a license to practice.
There is now in possession of his grandson, William Eaton, Jr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
(who shared his confidences and affections, and is a worthy
representative of his principles and virtues), an old London-bound
edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, which was used
by him, and which is highly valued as a family relic. Like
all persons of taste, he admired the classic elegance of this
celebrated work, but regarded its author as too subservient to
power, and wanting in manliness and independence. He considered
Sir Edward Coke a much better friend to English
liberty. * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Stability and consistency were strong points in Mr. Macon's
character, formed upon his uncompromising adherence to
principle and unswerving fidelity to duty. In his conversation
he was easy and unaffected, in his manners and dress a
decided model of republican simplicity, pretentious in nothing;
all who approached him felt conscious of receiving the
civility and respect demanded by the nicest sense of propriety.
To these characteristics did he owe much of that firm hold
upon the confidence and esteem of his countrymen which sustained
him in the severe trials always to be met in the great
battle of life. His was an enduring popularity; it never
waned; it existed in as much vigor and freshness at the close
of his life as at any former period; it lived after him, and
it is the source of the highest gratification to his numerous
friends and admirers that he is still often quoted as the bright
exemplar of "the honest man and the wise and virtuous
statesman." * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Though so long honored, and so many years the depositary
of public honors and public trusts, Mr. Macon's was the rare
merit of never having solicited any one to vote for him, or
even intimated a wish that he should; and though no one
shared more fully the confidence of a large circle of influential
friends, his is the praise of never having solicited the
slightest interest for his own preferment. Public honors
sought him; he prized them only as the reward of faithful
and virtuous performance, and regarded place as the means
merely of bringing him in nearer contact with public duty.
He made no popular harangues, seeking to avoid temptation
of being betrayed into promises which he could not or would
not fulfill, or into protestations which his heart would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sanction. He was never found rambling through his Congressional
District, seeking to engineer himself into popular
favor by means which self-respect and a just sense of the
rights of others forbade. His rule was to attend punctually,
once a year, if health permitted, the first court held in each
county in his district after his return from Congress. There
he met his constituents, there he received their greetings and
heard their complaints; there, without simulation, gave a
full account of his stewardship. In his intercourse with
them he was easy, frank, and communicative, never withholding
his opinion upon matters of public concernment, and
always inviting them to the exercise of the utmost freedom
of thought and of speech as the highest privilege of freemen
and the surest guard of liberty. He never attended what,
in his own characteristic language, he called "a man-dinner,"
regarding all such political pageants as having too much deceptious
exterior, and as being too little calculated to better
the popular heart or enlighten the popular mind. And when,
upon his retirement from Congress, a large portion of his old
constituents tendered him the compliment of a public dinner,
he declined it in a brief note, saying that "he had never been
at such a show, and that he had already received the most
gratifying proofs of their good-will and esteem."</p>

<p>To shun all ostentatious display and the emptiness of pride
was, with him, a <em>principle</em>; and to do good to his fellow-men,
and to society, a rule of action which he scrupulously observed,
always abstaining, in the employment of his faculties, and in
the use of the abundant goods with which frugal industry
had blessed him, from the gratification of any passion, the
indulgence of which prudence forbade to others less favored
by fortune&mdash;thus teaching, by both precept and example, the
necessity of temperance, frugality and industry, as the surest
and best foundation for contentment and plenty.</p>

<p>Of generous and unsuspicious nature, he never looked with
uncharitableness on the actions of his fellow-men, but, with
the strength and armor of a well-balanced mind, gave to them
the calmest consideration and assigned to each its appropriate
place in the scale of good and evil. Of philosophic mind,
subdued temper, and great self-command, he met the incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and accidents of life, not with stoic indifference, but
with quiet submission&mdash;yielding nothing to passion, less to
despondency, and looking to passing events as to a school for
instruction, and deducing from them useful lessons to guide
him in the pathway of life.</p>

<p>Of him it may be emphatically said, that he thought for
himself, but reposing, with confidence, on his discriminating
sense of justice and integrity of purpose, he gave to all subjects
the fullest deliberation, and never jumped to conclusions
in advance of his judgment. But when he had formed an
opinion he adhered to it with a fearless and virtuous inflexibility
which yielded to no importunity or persuasion. This,
with some, subjected him to the charge of obstinacy.</p>

<p>
"Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes."<br />
</p>

<p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>He was chary of promises, but always punctual and exact
in performance; would give his bond or note to no man,
contract no debts, would buy nothing without paying for it.
"Pay as you go" was a law to him which he inflexibly observed.
He mastered all his wants and kept them in strict
subjection to reason. He would lend money to a friend, but
never take interest. He classed labor among the virtues,
never called for help in anything he could do himself,
labored often in his fields at the head of his slaves, during
the intervals allowed from public duties, and topped all his
own tobacco, when at home at the proper season, till the
infirmities of age rendered him unable to stand the heat of
the sun. He was fond of the chase and indulged in his favorite
amusement, the pursuit of the fox and the deer, as long
as he lived.</p>

<p>He spoke often in Congress&mdash;seldom long. His speeches
were always to the point, strong, practical, sententious, often
furnishing materials for the rhetorical displays of others. A
most distinguished member once characterized his speeches as
"dishes of the best material served up in the best manner."
Unless prevented by bad health, he was always in his seat,
voted on every question, was punctual in attendance upon
committees, and ever ready at the call of duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He was fond of reading, but his favorite study was man.
"He made choice of human nature for the object of his
thoughts." To this predilection did he owe that consummate
knowledge of the human character, and those practical lessons
of wisdom (of so much consequence in the conduct of life)
which gave him rank among the "wisest and best."</p>

<p>There is no surer test of merit than is found in the favorable
opinions of the wise and the good, formed in the unrestricted
freedom of social intercourse, when the seal of reserve is unloosed,
and neither the pride of ostentation nor the dread of
criticism or censure invites to concealment. Impressed with
this truth, with a view to impart deeper interest to this sketch,
by stamping the seal of verity upon the high and noble traits
it portrays, recourse is had to the correspondence of eminent
and distinguished statesmen, to whom all the avenues of
knowledge were opened by close intimacy and long association
in public life. Thomas Jefferson, whose monument is to
be found in the Declaration of Independence, and in the enduring
popular veneration which he so largely shared, but a
few weeks after his first inauguration as President of the
United States, in 1801, thus writes to Mr. Macon: "And in
all cases when an office becomes vacant in your State, as the
distance would occasion a great delay, were you to wait to be
regularly consulted, I shall be much obliged to you to recommend
the best characters. There is nothing I am so anxious
about as making the best possible appointments, and no case
in which the best men are more liable to mislead us by yielding
to the solicitations of applicants. For this reason your own
spontaneous recommendation would be desirable." Thus did
Mr. Jefferson stake an important portion of his administrative
duties upon his high estimate of Mr. Macon's integrity and
wisdom. Again, in another letter to Mr. Macon, the 24th of
March, 1826, Mr. Jefferson says: "My grandson, Thomas
Jefferson Randolph, the bearer of this letter, on a journey to
the North, will pass two or three days, perhaps, in Washington.
I cannot permit him to do this without presenting him
to a friend of so long standing, whom I consider as the strictest
of our models of genuine republicanism. Let him be able to
say, when you are gone, but not forgotten, that he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Nathaniel Macon, upon whose tomb will be written, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultimus
Romanorum!</i>' I only ask you to give him a hearty shake
of the hand, on my account, as well as his own, assuring you
he merits it as a citizen, to which I will add my unceasing
affection to yourself."  *  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>

<p>Of Mr. Macon's claims to distinction, and to take rank on
the roll of fame among the first of those who embellish the
pages of American history, that sagacious statesman, John
Randolph of Roanoke, whose perception of character was
rarely at fault, in a letter to Mr. Macon, 14th December,
1828, thus speaks: "Your kind letter of the 10th is just
now received. Many, many thanks for it. I am truly concerned
at the causes which justly occasion you uneasiness; yet,
when I reflect, I know of no man in the United States whom
I would so soon be as yourself. There is no one who stands
so fair in the public estimation; and, with the single exception
of General Washington, there is not one of your times who
will stand so fair with posterity as yourself. There are
various sorts of reputations in the world. Some are obtained
by cringing and puffing, some are actually begged for and
given as an alms to importunity, some are carried by sheer
impudence. No one has had a better opportunity of observing
this than yourself; and there is no keener observer."</p>

<p>Upon such testimonials as these, from such high and pure
sources, the reputation of this just and virtuous man may
safely repose. They bespeak a name and a fame which dignify
humanity, and invest his memory with a usefulness scarcely
less to be prized than his services while living.</p>

<p>This sketch would be imperfect did it not notice the suggestive
fact that in his latter years Mr. Macon had painful
misgivings for the future of his country. 'Tis true he did not
parade his opinions before the public gaze, preferring rather
to encourage, not to alarm, the popular mind; but often when
his thoughts were turned on what he deemed the political
distempers and proclivities of the times, did he say to a friend
in his own pregnant language: "I am afraid of all my labors
have been for nothing"&mdash;obviously referring to his hardships
in the tented field and his arduous and well-directed labors
in the councils of his country, having devoted to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
patriotic offices the greater part of a long life, commencing
before manhood and ending with its close. At one period he
reposed with entire confidence on the conviction that popular
rights and public liberty were effectually secured by the Constitution
of the United States, but this hopeful reliance failed
him as early as 1824. In a debate, at that period, in the
Senate of the United States, on the bill for a subscription to
the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, Mr. Macon said: "I
rise with a full heart to take my last farewell of an old friend
that I have always admired and loved&mdash;the Constitution of
the United States. * * * In times of old, whenever any
question touching the Constitution was brought forward, it
was discussed day after day; that time is now passed. * * * Do
a little now and a little then, and by and by you will
render the government as powerful and unlimited as the
British government was. We go on deciding these things
without looking at the Constitution; and I suppose we will,
in a few years, do as was done in England. We shall appoint
a committee to hunt for precedents. My heart is full
when I think of all this; and what is to become of us I cannot
say. * * * My fears may be groundless; they may be
nothing but the suggestions of a worn-out old man; but they
are sincere, and I am alarmed for the safety of this government."</p>

<p>In vain did he then, as often before, raise his warning
voice against the dangers of inroads upon the Constitution.
And now that the direst calamities are upon us, resulting from
its utter overthrow and its base prostitution by wicked men
to the worst and most wicked purposes&mdash;how loudly do they
proclaim the unerring sagacity of his gifted and far-reaching
mind!</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In person Macon was above the middle size, of florid but
fair complexion, keen blue eyes, animated but kindly countenance,
not very good-looking, but possessed of a symmetrical
form and strength of body. His manners were simple and
unostentatious, but not without sufficient dignity and firmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>He was married early in life to Miss Hannah Plummer, of
Warren, his own county.</p>

<p>A good story is told of the way he won her. He proposed
in her presence to his rival that they should settle their claim
to her hand by a game of cards. This was agreed to and
Macon lost. He then raised up his hands, and with eyes
fixed on the object of his affection, exclaimed: "Hannah,
notwithstanding I have lost you fairly, love is superior to
honesty: I cannot give you up." He won, and was married
to her October 9th, 1783.</p>

<p>He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1791,
and served continuously until 1815, when he was elected to
the Senate. He was also a trustee of the University and a
justice of the peace, both of which offices he gave up in 1828,
at the time he resigned his seat in the Senate.</p>

<p>He was not a party man, but believed in true democracy.
He complained often that some of the most vital parts of the
Constitution had been construed or enacted away before he
left Congress. He was a strict constructionist.</p>

<p>He presided over the Constitutional Convention of 1835,
and took part in its deliberations upon the more important
questions. With Gaston, he favored religious toleration, and
made a speech against the clause in the old Constitution prohibiting
all but those of the Protestant religion from holding
any office of trust or profit in North Carolina.</p>

<p>He was averse to having his picture taken. This peculiarity
grew on him, until in very old age he is said to have
threatened a persistent picture-maker with libel if, as he had
suggested, he should take his (Macon's) picture without his
knowledge. Hardly a growth so strong and rugged without
some gnarls and knots. The picture of him given in this
book is from a portrait by Randall, and is pronounced a good
likeness by Mr. J. A. Egerton (an old neighbor) and others
who knew him intimately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>He paid his physician attending him in his last illness before
he died, and directed the details of his burial.</p>

<p>The <cite>Life of Macon</cite> was written in 1840 by Edward R.
Cotten; but in his book of two hundred and seventy-two
pages, Cotten says comparatively little of Macon, and devotes
most of his space to his own views on many subjects, Macon's
opinions and acts sometimes furnishing the text. If the book
was not entitled <cite>Life of Macon</cite> it would be more interesting.
As indicating what a Warren county gentleman of much
leisure and considerable reading, of good associates and ordinary
capacity, was thinking about in 1840, the book ought to
be preserved.</p>

<p>In order to give an idea of Macon's directness and simplicity,
I offer an abbreviated report of one of his speeches
made in the Senate, taken almost at random from the <cite>Abridgment
of the Debates of Congress</cite>. The time was January
20, 1820. The question was the admission of Missouri, as
well as Maine, into the Union. The protected States urged
an amendment restricting slavery in Missouri before it should
be admitted as a State, which amendment Mr. Macon opposed
with his usual sound sense. The speech is imperfectly reported,
but contains the germ of almost all that could have
been said on the subject from his standpoint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h3><a name="SPEECH" id="SPEECH">SPEECH ON THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Nathaniel Macon</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. Macon, of North Carolina, said that he agreed in opinion
with the gentleman who had declared this to be the
greatest question ever debated in the Senate, and that it
ought to be discussed in the calmest manner, without attempting
to excite passion or prejudice. It was, however, to be regretted
that while some of those who supported the motion
were quite calm and cool they used a good many hard words,
which had no tendency to continue the good humor which
they recommended. He would endeavor to follow their advice,
but must be pardoned for not following their example
in the use of hard words. If, however, one should escape
him, it would be contrary to his intention, and an act of indiscretion,
not of design or premeditation. He hoped to examine
the subject with great meekness and humility.</p>

<p>The debate had brought forcibly to his recollection the
anxiety of the best patriots of the nation, when the present
Constitution was examined by the State conventions which
adopted it. The public mind was then greatly excited, and
men in whom the people properly placed the utmost confidence
were divided. There was then no whisper about disunion,
for every one considered the Union as absolutely necessary
for the good of all. But to-day we have been told by
the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lowrie)
that he would prefer disunion rather than that slaves should
be carried west of the Mississippi. Age, Mr. Macon said, may
have rendered him timid, or education may have prevailed on
him to attach greater blessings to the Union and the Constitution
than they deserve. If this be the case, and it be
an error, it was one he had no desire to be free from even
after what he had heard in this debate. Get clear of this
Union and it will be found vastly more difficult to unite again
and form another. There were no parties in the country at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the time it was formed, not even upon this question. The
men who carried the nation through the Revolution were alive,
and members of the Convention. Washington was at their
head. Have we a Washington now? No. Is there one in the
nation to fill his place? No. His like, if ever, has been rarely
seen; nor can we, rationally, expect another in our day. Let
us not speak of disunion as an easy thing. If ever it shall
come, it will bring evils enough for the best men to
encounter, and all good men, in every nation, lovers of
freedom, will lament it. This Constitution is now as much
an experiment as it was in the year 1789. It went into operation
about the time the French Revolution commenced. The
wars which grew out of that, and the difficulties and perplexities
which we had to encounter, in consequence of the improper
acts of belligerents, kept the people constantly attached
to the government. It has stood well the trial of trouble and
of war, and answered, in those times, the purposes for which
it was formed and adopted; but now it is to be tried, in time
of universal peace, whether a government within a government
can sustain itself and preserve the liberty of the citizen.
When we hear the exclamation "Disunion, rather than slaves
be carried over the Mississippi," it ought not to be forgotten
that the union of the people and the Confederation carried us
through the Revolutionary war (a war of which no man can
wish to see the like again in this country); but, as soon as
peace came, the Confederation was found to be entirely unfit
for it; so unfit that it was given up for the present Constitution.
Destroy this Union, and what may be the condition of
the country, no man, not the most sagacious, can even imagine.
It will surely be much worse than it was before the
Constitution was adopted; and that must be well remembered.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment is calculated to produce geographical
parties, or why admonish us to discuss it with moderation
and good temper? No man who has witnessed the
effect of parties nearly geographical can wish to see them
revived. Their acts formerly produced uneasiness, to say the
least of them, to good men of every party. General Washington
has warned us against them; but he is now dead, and
his advice may soon be forgotten; form geographical parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and it will be discarded. Instead of forming sectional parties
it would be more patriotic to do them away. But party and
patriotism are not always the same. Town meetings and
resolutions to inflame one part of the nation against another
can never benefit the people, though they may gratify an
individual. Leave the people to form their own opinions,
without the aid of inflammatory speeches at town meetings,
and they will always form them correctly. No town meeting
was necessary to inform or inflame the public mind against
the law giving members of Congress a salary instead of a daily
allowance. The people formed their own opinions, disapproved
it, and it was repealed. So they will always act if
left to themselves. Let not parties formed at home for State
purposes be brought into Congress to disturb and distract the
Union. The general government hitherto has been productive
enough of parties to satisfy those who most delight in
them; so that they are not likely to be long wanted in it.
Enough, and more than enough, has been produced by the
difficulty of deciding what is and what is not within the limits
of the Constitution. And, at this moment, we have difficulties
enough to scuffle with without adding the present question.
The dispute between the Bank of the United States
and the State banks, the want of money by the government,
the increase of taxes in the midst of increasing debts, and the
dispute with Spain might serve for this session.</p>

<p>All the States now have equal rights and all are content.
Deprive one of the least right which it now enjoys in common
with the others, and it will no longer be content. So, if the
Government had an unlimited power to put whatever conditions
it pleased on the admission of a new State into the Union,
a State admitted with a condition unknown to the others
would not be content, no matter what might be the character
of the condition, even though it was not to steal or commit
murder. The difference in the terms of admission would not
be acceptable. All the new States have the same rights that
the old have, and why make Missouri an exception? She
has not done a single act to deserve it, and why depart, in
her case, from the great American principle that the people
of each State can govern themselves? No reason has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
assigned for the attempt at the departure, nor can one be assigned
which would not apply as strongly to Louisiana. In
every free country that ever existed the first violations of the
principles of government were indirect and not well understood,
or supported with great zeal by only a part of the
people.</p>

<p>All the country west of the Mississippi was acquired by the
same treaty, and on the same terms, and the people in every
part have the same rights; but, if the amendment be adopted,
Missouri will not have the same rights which Louisiana now
enjoys. She has been admitted into the Union as a full sister,
but her twin-sister, Missouri, under the proposed amendment,
is to be admitted as a sister of the half-blood, or rather as a
stepdaughter, under an unjust stepmother&mdash;for what? Because
she, as well as Louisiana, performed well her part during
the late war, and because she has never given the general
government any trouble. The operation of the amendment
is unjust as it relates to the people who have moved there from
other States. They carried with them the property which was
common in the States they left, secured to them by the Constitution
and laws of the United States as well as by the treaty.
There they purchased public lands and settled with their
slaves, without a single objection to their owning and carrying
them; but now, unfortunately for them, after they have
been to the trouble and expense of building houses and clearing
plantations in the new country it has been discovered that
they had no right to carry their slaves with them and that they
must now move and make room for those who are considered
a better people. The country was bought with the money
of all, slaveholders as well as those who are not; and every one
knew when he bought land and moved with his property he
had a perfect right to do so. And no one till last session ever
said to the contrary or moved the restriction about slaves.
The object now avowed is to pen up the slaves and their owners,
and not permit them to cross the Mississippi to better their
condition, where there is room enough for all and good range
for man and beast. (And man is as much improved by moving
and range as the beast of the field.) But what is still more
unaccountable, a part of the land granted to the soldiers for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
their services in the late war was laid off in Missouri expressly
for the soldiers who had enlisted in the Southern
States, and would prefer living where they might have slaves.
These too are now to leave the country of their choice and
the land obtained by fighting the battles of the nation. Is
this just in a government of law, supported only by opinion?
for it is not pretended that it is a government of force. In
the most alarming state of our affairs at home&mdash;and some of
them have an ugly appearance&mdash;public opinion alone has corrected
and changed that which seemed to threaten disorder
and ill-will into order and good-will, except once, when the
military was called out in 1791. Let this be compared to the
case of individuals and it will not be found to be more favorable
to the amendment than the real case just stated. A and
B buy a tract of land large enough for both and for their
children, and settle it, build houses and open plantations.
When they have got it in good way to live comfortably, after
ten or fifteen years, A thinks there is not too much for him
and his children, and that they can, a long time hence, settle
and cultivate the whole land. He then for the first time tells
B that he has some property he does not like, and that he
must get clear of it or move. B states the bargain. A answers
that it is true he understood it so until of late, but that
move he must or get clear of his property; for that property
should not be in his way. The kind or quality of property
cannot affect the question.</p>

<p>A wise legislature will always consider the character, condition
and feelings of those to be legislated for. In a government
and people like ours this is indispensable. The question
now under debate demands this consideration. To a part
of the United States, and that part which supports the amendment,
it cannot be important except as it is made so by the
circumstances of the time. In all questions like the present,
in the United States, the strong may yield without disgrace
even in their own opinion; the weak cannot. Hence the
propriety of not attempting to impose this new condition on
the people of Missouri. Their numbers are few compared to
those of the whole United States. Let the United States
then abandon this new scheme, let their magnanimity and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
their power be felt by the people of Missouri. The attempt
to govern too much has produced every civil war that ever
has been, and probably every one that ever may be. All
governments, no matter what their form, want more power
and more authority, and all the governed want less government.
Great Britain lost the United States by attempting to
govern too much and to introduce new principles of governing.
The United States would not submit to the attempt,
and earnestly endeavored to persuade Great Britain to abandon
it, but in vain. The United States would not yield, and
the result is known to the world. The battle is not always to
the strong nor the race to the swift. What reason have we
to expect that we can persuade Missouri to yield to our opinion
that did not apply as strongly to Great Britain? They are
as near akin to us as we were to Great Britain. They are
"flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone." But as to kin, when
they fall out they do not make up sooner than other people.
Great Britain attempted to govern us on a new principle, and
we are attempting to establish a new principle for the people
of Missouri on becoming a State. Great Britain attempted to
collect a threepenny tax on the tea consumed in the then
colonies, which were not represented in Parliament; and we to
regulate what shall be property when Missouri becomes a
State, when she has no vote in Congress. The great English
principle of no tax without representation was violated in
one case, and the great American principle, that people are
able to govern themselves, will be violated if the amendment
be adopted. Every free nation has had some principle in its
government to which more importance was attached than to
any other. The English principle was not to be taxed without
the consent of the people given in Parliament; the American
principle is the right of the people to form their State
governments in their own way, provided they be not inconsistent
with the Constitution of the United States. If the
power in Congress to pass the restriction was expressly delegated,
and so clear that no one could doubt it, in the present
circumstances of the country, it would still not be wise or
prudent to do so; especially against the consent of those who
live in the territory. Their consent would be more important
to the nation than a restriction which would not make one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
slave less, unless indeed they might be starved in the old
States.</p>

<p>Let me not be understood as wishing or intending to create
any alarm as to the intentions of the people of Missouri. I
know nothing of them. But in examining the question, we
ought not to forget our own history nor the character of those
who settle on our frontiers. Your easy chimney-corner
people, the timid and fearful, never move to them. They
stay where there is no danger from an Indian or any wild
beast. They have no desire to engage the panther or the
bear. It is the bravest of the brave and the boldest of the
bold who venture there. They go not to return.</p>

<p>The settling of Kentucky and Tennessee during the war
of the Revolution proves in the most satisfactory manner
what they can do and will undergo, and that they will not
return. The few people who first settled there had to contend,
without aid from the States, against all the Indians bordering
on the United States except the Chickasaw and Choctaw
nations, and maintained their stations. The northern
tribes, unaided by the southern, attacked the United States
since the adoption of the Constitution and defeated two
armies, and it required a third to conquer them. The frontier
people in the Revolutionary war, as well as in the late,
astonished everybody by their great exploits. Vermont,
though claimed in the Revolutionary war by New Hampshire
and New York, was not inferior to any of the States in
her exertions to support independence.</p>

<p>The gentleman from Pennsylvania will pardon me for stating
that that State had had some experience of its government
managing a few people who would not yield obedience to its
authority, though settled within its limits. They were obliged
to compromise. I mean the Wyoming settlers. Again, since
this government was in operation, a few people settled on the
Indian lands: they were ordered to move from them, but did
not obey: the military was sent to burn their cabins. The
commanding officer told them his business, and very humanely
advised them to move what property they had out of
them. This they did, and their cabins were burnt. They
waited till the troops marched, and very soon after built new
cabins on the same places and to the same chimneys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>These facts are stated to show that a contest with a people
who believe themselves right and one with a government are
very different things. It would have been very gratifying to
me to have been informed by some one of the gentlemen who
support the amendment what is intended to be done if it be
adopted, and the people of Missouri will not yield, but go
on and form a State government (having the requisite number
of inhabitants agreeably to the ordinance), as Tennessee did,
and then apply for admission into the Union. Will she be
admitted, as Tennessee was, on an equal footing with the
original States, or will the application be rejected as the British
government did the petitions of the old Congress?</p>

<p>If you do not admit her, and she will not return to the territorial
government, will you declare the people rebels, as Great
Britain did us, and then order them to be conquered for
contending for the same rights that every State in the Union
now enjoys? Will you for this, order the father to march
against son and brother against brother? God forbid! It
would be a terrible sight to behold these near relations plunging
the bayonet into each other for no other reason than because
the people of Missouri wish to be on equal footing
with the people of Louisiana. When Territories they were
equal. Those who remember the Revolution will not desire
to see another civil war in our land. They know too well the
wretched scenes it will produce. If you should declare them
rebels and conquer them, will that attach them to the Union?
No one can expect this. Then do not attempt to do that for
them which was never done for others, and that which no
State would consent for Congress to do for it. If the United
States are to make conquests, do not let the first be at home.
Nothing is to be got by American conquering American. Nor
ought we to forget that we are not legislating for ourselves,
and that the American character is not yielding when rights
are concerned. But why depart from the old way, which has
kept us in quiet, peace and harmony, every one living under
his own vine and fig-tree and none to make him afraid? Why
leave the road of experience, which has satisfied all and made
all happy, to take this new way, of which we have no experience?
This way leads to universal emancipation, of which
we have no experience. The Eastern and Middle States furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
none. For years before these States emancipated their
slaves they had but few, and of them a part were sold to the
South. We have no more experience or book-learning on this
subject than the French Convention had which turned the
slaves of Santo Domingo loose. Nor can we foresee the consequences
which may result from this new motion clearer than
the Convention did in their decree.</p>

<p>A clause in the Declaration of Independence has been read
declaring that "all men are created equal." Follow that
sentiment, and does it not lead to universal emancipation? If
it will justify putting an end to slavery in Missouri, will it
not justify it in the old States? Suppose the plan followed
and all the slaves turned loose, and the Union to continue, is
it certain that the present Constitution would last long? The
rich would in such circumstances want titles and hereditary
distinctions, the negro food and raiment, and they would be as
much or more degraded than in their present condition. The
rich might hire these wretched people, and with them attempt
to change the government by trampling on the rights of those
who have only property enough to live comfortably. Opinions
have greatly changed in some of the States in a few years.
The time has been when those now called slaveholding States
were thought to be the firm and steadfast friends of the
people and of liberty. Then they were opposing an administration
and a majority in Congress supported by a sedition law;
then there was not a word heard, at least from one side, about
those who actually did most toward changing the administration
and the majority in Congress, and they were from
slaveholding States. And now it would be curious to know
how many members of Congress actually hold seats in consequence
of their exertions at the time alluded to. Past services
are always forgotten when new principles are to be introduced.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the people who move from the non-slaveholding
to slaveholding States, when they became slaveholders,
by purchase or marriage, expect more labor from them
than those do who are brought up among them.</p>

<p>To the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Burrill) I tender
my hearty thanks for his liberal and true statement of the
treatment of slaves in the Southern States. His observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
leave but little for me to add, which is this, that the slaves
gained as much by independence as the free. The old ones
are better taken care of than any poor in the world, and
treated with decent respect by their white acquaintances. I
sincerely wish that he and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
(Mr. Roberts) would go home with me, or some other Southern
member, and witness the meeting between slaves and
owner and see the glad faces and hearty shaking of hands.
This is well described in General Moultrie's <cite>Memoirs of the
American Revolution</cite>, in which he gives the account of his
reception by his slaves the first time he went home after he
was exchanged. He was made prisoner at the surrender of
Charleston. Could he (Mr. Macon) have procured the book in
the city he intended to have read it to show the attachment
of the slave to his owner. A fact shall be stated. An excellent
friend of mine&mdash;he too, like the other characters which
have been mentioned in the debate, was a Virginian&mdash;had business
in England which made it necessary that he should go to
that country himself or send a trusty agent. He could not go
conveniently, so he sent one of his slaves, who remained there
near a year. Upon his return he was asked by his owner how
he liked the country, and if he would have liked to stay there?
He replied that to oblige him he would have stayed; the
country was the finest he ever saw; the land was worked as
nice as a square in a garden; they had the finest horses and
carriages, and houses, and everything; but that the white servants
abused his country. What did they say? They said
we owed them (the English) a heap of money, and would not
pay; to which he added, their chief food was mutton; he saw
very little bacon there. The owner can make more free in
conversation with his slave and be more easy in his company
than the rich man, where there is no slave, with the white
hireling who drives his carriage. He has no expectation that
the slave will, for the free and easy conversation, expect to
call him fellow-citizen or act improperly.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia have been
mentioned by Senators in this debate, and it has frequently
been said that the two first had emancipated their slaves;
from which an inference seems to be drawn that the other
might have done so: emancipation to these gentlemen seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to be quite an easy task. It is so when there are but very
few slaves; and would be more easy did not the color everywhere
place the blacks in a degraded state. Where they enjoy
the most freedom they are there degraded. The respectable
whites do not permit them to associate with them or to be of
their company when they have parties. But if it be so easy a
task, how happens it that Virginia, which before the Revolution
endeavored to put an end to the African slave-trade, has
not attempted to emancipate? It will not be pretended that
the great men of other States were superior or greater lovers
of liberty than her Randolph, the first President of the first
Congress, her Washington, her Henry, her Jefferson, or her
Nelson. None of these ever made the attempt, and their
voices ought to convince every one that it is not an easy task
in that State. And is it not wonderful, that if the Declaration
of Independence gave authority to emancipate, the patriots
who made it never proposed any plan to carry it into
execution? This motion, whatever is pretended by its friends,
must lead to it. And is it not equally wonderful that if the
Constitution gives the authority, this is the first attempt ever
made, under either, by the Federal Government to exercise
it? For if under either the power is given, it will apply as
well to States as to Territories. If either intended to give it,
is it not still more wonderful that it is not given in direct
terms? The gentleman would not then be put to the trouble
of searching the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution
and the laws for a sentence or a word to form a few doubts.
If the words of the Declaration of Independence be taken as
part of the Constitution (and that they are no part of it is as
true as that they are no part of any other book), what will be
the condition of the Southern country when this shall be carried
into execution? Take the most favorable view which
can be supposed, that no convulsion ensue, that nothing like
massacre or war of extermination take place as in Santo Domingo,
but that whites and blacks do not marry and produce
mulatto States, will not the whites be compelled to move and
leave their lands and houses and abandon the country to the
blacks? And are you willing to have black members of Congress?
But if the scenes of Santo Domingo should be re-acted,
would not the tomahawk and the scalping-knife be mercy?</p>

<small>BY WM. A. GRAHAM</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>Archibald D. Murphy was, in the generation immediately
preceding our own, one of the most eminent characters in
North Carolina. In many of the attributes of a statesman
and philosopher he excelled all his contemporaries in the
State, and, in every department of exertion to which his mind
was applied, he had few equals or seconds. As an advocate
at the bar, a judge on the bench, a reporter of the decisions
of the highest court of justice, a legislator of comprehensive
intelligence, enterprise and patriotism, a literary man of
classic taste, attainments and style in composition, his fame is
a source of just pride to his friends and his country. But for
the paucity of our information, and the pressure of time and
circumstances in the preparation of this sketch, it would be a
labor of love to review his earlier years and trace the development
and progress of his career in youth. Neither materials
nor leisure for this topic, however, are now at our command.</p>

<p>His father, Colonel Archibald Murphy, was a conspicuous
citizen of the county of Caswell, and bore a part in the military
service in the war of the Revolution, for which the
citizens of that county, and especially of his vicinity, were
greatly distinguished. The residence of his father was about
two miles from Red House, in the congregation of Rev. Mr.
McAden, a Presbyterian minister, whose son, the late Dr.
John McAden, married the daughter of Colonel Murphy, by
whom he left descendants who still survive. At this place,
some seven miles from Milton, Archibald DeBow Murphy,
the subject of our memoir, was born, we believe, in the year
1777. Of the other children of his parents there were two
brothers and four sisters. His education, preparatory to
admission into the infant University of the State at Chapel
Hill, was received in the school of the Rev. Dr. David Caldwell,
of Guilford county. Of the opportunities for education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
during his youth, Mr. Murphy himself informs us that
before the University went into operation, in 1795, there were
not more than three schools in the State in which the rudiments
of a classical education could be acquired, and that the
most prominent and useful of these was that of Dr. Caldwell;
that the deficiency of books for literary instruction, except in
the libraries of a few lawyers in the commercial towns, was
still greater, and by way of illustration he relates that after
completing his course of studies under Dr. Caldwell he spent
nearly two years without finding any books to read except
some old works on theological subjects, and that then chance
threw in his way Voltaire's history of Charles XII. of Sweden,
an odd volume of <cite>Roderick Random</cite> and an abridgment of
<cite>Don Quixote</cite>. These constituted his whole stock of literary
furniture when he entered college in 1796. When we remember
that he afterwards became capable of writing like
Goldsmith, and with an ease and rapidity that Goldsmith could
not have equaled, we can but recall these reminiscences of
earlier times and encourage the diligent student by his example.
With a mind delighted by a consciousness of advancement
in knowledge, and spirit of emulation, he profited
greatly by three years of study in the University, and graduated
with the highest distinction in 1799.</p>

<p>Such was the reputation acquired by him in this period that
he was at once appointed Professor of Ancient Languages
in his <i>alma mater</i>&mdash;a situation in which he continued
the three succeeding years, and in which he matured that
scholarship and taste for liberal studies which so much distinguished
him among his professional brethren and the educated
gentlemen of the State. His admission to the bar took
place in 1802, after a course of professional reading so limited
that the first judge to whom he applied (the signatures of two
being then necessary for a license) refused to examine him;
and (as he was accustomed to amuse his friends by relating)
his success, only a few months later, in gaining admission to
the practice in all the courts at once, was owing to the good
fortune of bearing a letter from a friend, at the succeeding
term of the Court of Conference, to one of the judges, a
gentleman of proverbial benevolence and kindness, who conducted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the examination, or interview, in his own chamber,
and procured the signatures of his brethren without so much
having been requested or expected&mdash;so little strictness was observed
towards the few applicants then entering the profession.</p>

<p>But if he was allowed admission <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex gratia</i>, and without the
requisite amount of learning, he was not long in supplying
the deficiency. The powers of mind and eagerness in quest
of knowledge which had been exhibited in his scholastic
studies enabled him to make rapid progress in the law. His
professional studies were directed by William Duffy, Esq.,
an eminent lawyer, then residing in Hillsborough, to whom he
was ever afterwards affectionately attached, and to whose
memory he paid a grateful tribute among his sketches of
public and professional men of North Carolina, in an oration
before the Literary Societies of the University in his latter
years. Mr. Murphy advanced rapidly to the first rank
of the advocates of his day, and notwithstanding his turning
aside, to the indulgence of his tastes for general literature, his
enlightened labors and bright career in legislation, his promotion
and service on the bench for two years, his decayed
health and irregular attendance on the courts in his latter
days, he maintained his position in the public estimation, even
to the end of his life. When it is remembered that among
his competitors at one time or another, for more than a
quarter of a century, were Archibald Henderson, Cameron,
Norwood, Nash, Seawell, Yancey, Ruffin, Badger, Hawks,
Mangum, and Morehead, it must be admitted that he was
at a bar where the remark of Pinkney that "it was not a
place where a false and fraudulent reputation for talents can
be maintained," was fully justified. His practice for many
years was not exceeded by that of any gentleman in the State,
and his success corresponded with its extent. Both his examination
of witnesses and argument of causes before juries
on the circuit could not be excelled in skillfulness. He had
a Quaker-like plainness of aspect, a scrupulous cleanness and
neatness in an equally plain attire, an habitual politeness
and a subdued simplicity of manner which at once won his
way to the hearts of juries, while no Greek dialectician had a
more ready and refined ingenuity or was more fertile in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
resource of forensic gladiatorship. His manner of speaking
was never declamatory or in any sense boisterous, but in the
style of earnest and emphatic conversation, so simple and apparently
undesigning that he seemed to the jury to be but
interpreting their thoughts rather than enunciating his own,
yet with a correctness and often elegance of diction which no
severity of criticism could improve. A pattern of politeness
in all his intercourse, public and private, he could torture
an unwilling or corrupt witness into a full exposure of his
falsehood, and often had him impaled before he was aware of
his design; no advocate had at his command more effective
raillery, wit, and ridicule to mingle with his arguments.</p>

<p>Many of his speeches in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nisi prius</i> courts are still recollected
by the profession and the people of middle age in the
Fourth Circuit, and are spoken of with great admiration.
One of the last of these in which, though he was then broken
down by misfortune and enfeebled by disease, the fires of his
genius and eloquence shone out in the lustre of his palmiest
days, was made in the case of <i>Burrow</i> vs. <i>Worth</i>, in the Superior
Court of Randolph in 1830 or 1831. It was an action
for malicious prosecution against Dr. David Worth, a prominent
physician, charging him with having falsely and maliciously
caused the plaintiff, Burrow, to be presented for the
murder of one Carter, of whose wife it was pretended he was
the <em>paramour</em>. The plaintiff sought to show that not only
was the accusation against him false, but that Worth was himself
accessory to the murder which he alleged had been committed
by the wife of Carter, by poison, which he (Worth)
had furnished to her for that purpose, and he supported his
complaint with a well-combined scheme of perjury and
fraud which it required no ordinary skill and courage to
baffle. His chief witness was a married woman who was
found to be a member of a church, whose general character
was vouched by her acquaintances to be good, and who deposed
to a conversation between Worth and the wife of
Carter, in which it was agreed that for a base motive he
would provide her with arsenic with which she was to poison
her husband. It was further shown, and this was true, that
Worth had attended the deceased as a physician at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the alleged conspiracy against his life, so that the opportunity,
at least, was not wanting. Such was the aspect worn
by the case when this witness was tendered to Mr. Murphy,
the defendant's counsel, for cross-examination. By a series
of questions as to the time, place and circumstances, the furniture
in the room in which the conversation was located,
the relative positions of the parties and the witness, their previous
acquaintanceship, the course of the dialogue between
them, <i>et cetera</i>, he involved her in such a maze of inconsistencies,
contradictions, and improbabilities as to expose the
whole story as a base fabrication. The privilege of cross-examination
is often abused, though there is a consistency in
truth and incongruity in falsehood which, even in the case
of the least resolute witnesses, rarely allows such abuse to do
much harm. All perceived, in the case in question, that it
was one of the great tests of truth which cannot safely be dispensed
with in judicial proceedings. The evidence, as usually
happens in such cases, was quite voluminous; we have but
delineated its most prominent feature. Having for his client
a personal friend, threatened to be victimized by a foul conspiracy
for daring to perform one of the highest duties of a
citizen, in bringing at least a supposed murderer to justice,
Mr. Murphy in his defense, inspired by the theme, is said to
have delivered a speech which has never been surpassed in
the forensic displays of the State. Analysis, denunciation,
wit, ridicule, pathos, invective were in turn poured forth with
such telling effect that not only was the defendant triumphantly
acquitted, but it would have been dangerous for the
plaintiff had the question of his life or death been in the
hands of the jury. The audience alternately convulsed with
laughter, bathed in tears, or burning with indignation, were
enraptured with his eloquence, and could not be restrained
from demonstrations of applause.</p>

<p>Mr. Murphy delighted in the equity practice of his profession,
and was accustomed to speak of this branch of our jurisprudence
as the application of the rules of moral philosophy
to the practical affairs of men. More of the pleadings in
equity causes within the sphere and time of his practice will
be found in his handwriting than in that of any other solicitor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and, with two or three exceptions, among those named
above, he was by far the most adept as an equity pleader. He
wrote with facility and accuracy, even amid the crowd of
courts and confusion of clients, and his neat and peculiar
chirography, to those a little accustomed to it, was as legible
as print.</p>

<p>In the year 1818 he was elected by the General Assembly
a judge of the Superior Courts, and rode the circuits in that
capacity for two years, when he resigned and returned to the
practice of his profession. Under a clause in the criminal
law establishing the present Supreme Court system, passed
that session, which authorized the Governor by special commission
to detail a judge of the Superior Court to sit in stead
of a judge of the Supreme Court, in causes where any one
of their number had been of counsel or had an interest in the
result, he was commissioned by the Governor for this service,
and presided in the Supreme Court in several causes, in place
of Judge Henderson, who had been recently elected from the
bar. This provision of the law, being afterwards thought to
be in conflict with that clause of the Constitution which requires
the judges of the Supreme Court to be elected by the
General Assembly, was repealed. In his office as a judge he
well sustained his reputation for learning and ability, which
had been so well established at the bar, and attracted the admiration
of the profession and the people by the courtesy,
patience, dignity and justice which characterized his administration
of the laws. Before taking leave of his career as a
lawyer it is proper to mention his tribute to his profession in
three volumes of reports of the Supreme Court of the State,
embracing the decisions of cases of interest from 1804 to 1819.</p>

<p>From 1812 to 1818, inclusive, Mr. Murphy was continually
a Senator from the county of Orange in the General Assembly,
and on this new theatre shone more conspicuously than
he had done in his profession. He inaugurated a new era in
the public policy of the State, and for many years exerted a
greater influence in her counsels than any other citizen.
Judging from the public documents which he has left behind
him in advocacy of this policy, no man ever brought into our
legislative halls a more ardent spirit of patriotism, a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thorough survey and comprehension of her situation and
wants, or proposed bolder or more intelligent measures for her
relief. Whether these measures failed from error in their
conception or timidity in his contemporaries to meet and
boldly sustain them, the historian must pronounce that his
reports and other writings in regard to them are the noblest
monuments of philosophic statesmanship to be found in our
public archives since the days of the Revolution. From 1815
to 1823, either as chairman of a committee in the Legislature
or of the Board of Internal Improvement, he annually prepared
a report on the public policy of the State in relation to
her improvement in the means of transportation, and in 1819
he published a memoir on improvements contemplated and the
resources and finances of the State, dedicated to his friend
John Branch, then her Governor; any one of which papers
would have done honor to DeWitt Clinton or Calhoun, the
champions of internal improvement in the State and Federal
governments, respectively, during that period. Fully appreciating
the condition of the world resulting from the general
peace consequent on the battle of Waterloo and the overthrow
of the first Napoleon (since which time there has been a
greater advance in all the useful arts and diffusion of the
comforts of life among mankind than in any five preceding
centuries), he applied all the energies of his intrepid and well-furnished
mind to the task of devising how his native State
should most profit in this universal calm, confer the greatest
good on the greatest number of her people, and resume her
proper rank in the Union of which she was a member. His
solution of this important problem he seems to have summed
up in three propositions, namely: first by improving her means
of transportation, in deepening her inlets from the ocean,
opening her rivers for navigation, connecting these rivers by
canals, and constructing turnpike or macadamized roads, so
as to concentrate all her trade at two or three points within
her own limits; second, by building up commercial cities of
her own at these points, with a view to commercial independence
of other States, to the better regulation and control of
her currency and exchanges, and to cherish and stimulate a
just State pride; third, by a system of education commensurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with the State's necessities, embracing primary schools,
academies for instruction in the higher branches, the University
by greatly enlarging its accommodations and course of
instruction, and an asylum for the deaf and dumb. On this
last subject of education he made a report to the General Assembly
in 1817, comprehending these several topics, from
which, since our limits will not permit us to recur to it again,
we make one or two brief extracts as exhibitions of his style,
his public spirit and his noble benevolence. The University
then was, from causes which he details, in a state of extreme
depression. He says: "When the pride of the State is awakening
and an honorable ambition is cherished for her glory,
an appeal is made to the patriotism and generous feelings of
the Legislature in favor of an institution which in all civilized
nations has been regarded as the nursery of moral greatness
and the palladium of civil liberty. That people who
cultivate the sciences and the arts with most success acquire
a most enviable superiority over others. Learned men by
their discussions and works give a lasting splendor to national
character; and such is the enthusiasm of man that there is not
an individual, however humble in life his lot may be, who
does not feel proud to belong to a country honored with great
men and magnificent institutions. It is due to North Carolina,
it is due to the great men who first proposed the foundation
of the University, to foster it with parental fondness, and
to give to it an importance commensurate with the high destinies
of the State." We may here remark that although
much improvement has been made in the interim, yet even
after the lapse of forty-odd years the outline of a system of
studies in the University, which he therein proposed, has not
been filled up. Of the necessity of public instruction for
poor children he says: "Such has always been, and probably
always will be, the allotment of human life, that the poor
will form a large portion of every community; and it is the
duty of those who manage the affairs of a State to extend
relief to the unfortunate part of our species in every way in
their power. Providence, in the impartial distribution of its
favors, whilst it has denied to the poor many of the comforts
of life, has generally bestowed upon them the blessing of intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
children. Poverty is the school of genius; it is a
school in which the active powers of man are developed and
disciplined, and in which that moral courage is acquired which
enables him to toil with difficulties, privations and want.
From this school generally come forth those men who act the
principal parts upon the theatre of life; men who impress a
character upon the age in which they live. But it is a school
which if left to itself runs wild; vice in all its depraved forms
grows up in it. The State should take this school under her
special charge, and nurturing the genius which there grows in
rich luxuriance, give to it an honorable and profitable direction.
Poor children are the peculiar property of the State,
and by proper cultivation they will constitute a fund of intellectual
and moral worth which will greatly subserve the public
interest."</p>

<p>His greatest and most persevering exertions, however, were
devoted to the subject of internal improvement. His reports
and memoir on that and kindred topics were examined with
high commendation in the year 1822, in an article in the
North American Review, then under the editorial charge of
the Hon. Edward Everett. It must be borne in mind that
in that day the modern resource of the railroad for transportation
at long distances had entered the contemplation of no
one in Europe or America; sluices, canals and turnpike
roads were the only improvements deemed to be practical.
To effect these in the most approved methods, Mr. Hamilton
Fulton, an engineer of much reputation, was brought into the
service of the State from Europe, at a salary of twelve hundred
pounds sterling ($6,000) per annum, who made surveys
of all the harbors and rivers, and of many routes for roads in
all sections of the State. The main features of the plan of
Mr. Murphy, and to which he obtained the approbation of
Mr. Fulton, after the improvement of inlets at Nag's Head
(if practicable), Ocracoke, Beaufort, Swansborough, and Wilmington,
consisted in opening for batteau navigation the rivers
Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, Cape Fear, Yadkin, Catawba, Broad,
and sundry tributaries, and by canals to join the Roanoke and
Tar or Pamlico, and Neuse, so as to ship the productions of
the country watered by each of them from Beaufort; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
unite by similar means the Cape Fear with Lumber River,
and at a more northerly point with the Yadkin, and the Yadkin
with the Catawba, so as to bring to the mouth of the Cape
Fear the commerce of our whole watershed trending from the
Blue Ridge, except that of Broad River (which was to be
opened into South Carolina), and thus making commercial
marts of Fayetteville and Wilmington. Places and sections
more remote from these waters were to be supplied by roads.
The boldness and comprehensiveness of this plan, providing,
as it proposed to do, for the whole State, with the only facilities
then known to science, must be seen by all. Whether
it was practicable, and if so, at what cost, was a question for
engineers. It was in all probability practicable at a cost not
exceeding the amount which up to this time the State has
invested in railroads, and if accomplished it would evidently
have been a great advance beyond the cart and wagon, then
the only means of transportation in use. Its very comprehensiveness,
however, was probably the reason of its failure.
To conciliate favor, inadequate appropriations for various
parts of it in all sections of the State were made at once, and
work was commenced under incompetent supervision, which
resulted in failure. After a few years' trial the whole was
abandoned, and the engineer, whose salary had at no time
been less than twice that of the Governor of the State, was
discharged. Its miscarriage is the less to be regretted since
the iron rail and steam car, then undeveloped in the womb
of time, would have superseded, if not supplanted, the most
perfect works which it contemplated, so far as regards inland
transportation at least. But the fame of its author as a patriot,
statesman and sage should not be dimmed by mistakes
or failures in the details of its execution or the advances made
in the science of engineering in a subsequent age. The expenditures
upon it from the State treasury, including the
salaries of the principal engineer and assistants, did not exceed
$50,000, and this was repaid tenfold in the topographical
and statistical information which it elicited and caused to
be published, and in the loyal and true North Carolina patriotism
aroused by Mr. Murphy's discussions of the subject
in the hearts of her people. We have recurred to this matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of expenditure with some care, for the reason that before the
subject of internal improvement became popular in the State,
it was the custom of its opponents to hold up Mr. Murphy's
scheme of improvements as a kind of South Sea Bubble, from
which the treasury had been well-nigh rendered bankrupt.</p>

<p>While immersed in endeavors to press forward those projects
of improvement, and at the same time assiduously laboring
in his profession, either as a judge on the bench or a lawyer
at the bar, Mr. Murphy conceived the purpose of writing the
history of his native State. He had studied her interests by
every light of political economy and every record of the past
within his reach, was personally acquainted with nearly
every citizen of intelligence, and his talents, public spirit and
engaging manners had rendered him a favorite among the
surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolution. This latter
circumstance had made him acquainted with the traditions of
that period, and the great injustice by omission and commission
which the State had suffered at the hands of the writers of
history. He seems to have undertaken this task with the
same motives of zealous patriotism which had inspired his
legislative action. In a letter to General Joseph Graham, of
Lincoln, dated July 20, 1821, he says:</p>

<p>"Your letter to Colonel Conner first suggested to me the
plan of a work which I will execute if I live. It is a work
on the history, soil, climate, legislation, civil institutions, literature,
etc., of this State. Soon after reading your letter I
turned my attention to the subject in the few hours which I
could snatch from business, and was surprised to find what
abundant materials could, with care and diligence, be collected&mdash;materials
which if well disposed would furnish matter
for one of the most interesting works that has been published
in this country. We want such a work. We neither know
ourselves nor are we known to others. Such a work, well executed,
would add very much to our standing in the Union,
and make our State respectable in our own eyes. Amidst the
cares and anxieties which surround me, I cannot cherish a
hope that I could do more than merely guide the labors of
some man who would take up the work after me and prosecute
it to perfection. I love North Carolina, and love her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
more because so much injustice has been done to her. We
want pride. We want independence. We want magnanimity.
Knowing nothing of ourselves, we have nothing in
our history to which we can turn with conscious pride. We
know nothing of our State and care nothing about it. We
want some great stimulus to put us all in motion, and induce
us to waive little jealousies, and combine in one general march
to one great purpose."</p>

<p>His habits of labor, his readiness as a writer, and addiction
to literary exercise as a pleasure, the philosophical cast of his
mind, and above all, his sentiment of devotion to North Carolina,
eminently fitted him for this enterprise; and he seems to
have entered upon it with his characteristic industry and zeal.
He gathered materials for the work from a great variety of
sources, public and private, within and without the State.
At his instance the Legislature, through the intervention of
Mr. Gallatin, then the Minister of the United States in Great
Britain, caused the office of the Board of Trade and Plantations
and the State Paper Office in London to be explored,
and an index of the documents therein, pertaining to our colonial
history, to be furnished; literary men in other States,
including Mr. Madison and Mr. Jefferson, readily seconded
his efforts by supplying information sought of them; the
families of deceased public men in the State, including those
of Governor Burke, Governor Samuel Johnston, and Mr.
Hooper, opened all their papers to his inspection; and many
officers of the Revolution, then living, among whom were
Colonel William Polk, General Lenoir, Major Donoho, of
Caswell, General Graham, and divers others, undertook to
contribute to him their personal reminiscences of the war.
The memoranda of the gentleman last named, prepared in
accordance with a request of Mr. Murphy, were given to the
public in the pages of our <cite>University Magazine</cite> in the year
1856. Upon application of Mr. Murphy, by memorial, the
General Assembly at the session of 1826 granted him authority
to raise by lottery a sufficient sum for the publication
of his contemplated history, the plan of which he set forth
in detail. We regret that we have not at hand a copy of this
memorial to lay before our readers the outline of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as then prepared. It was more voluminous, and embraced
a greater variety of topics than would have been preferred
by the generality of readers, but its very magnitude showed
the comprehension of his genius and the intrepidity of his
mind. Beyond one or two chapters on the Indian tribes of
the State, he appears to have done but little towards its composition,
though his collection of materials, directing attention
to the subject, and rescuing from oblivion much that was
passing away, rendered the undertaking itself a great public
benefit. Decayed health and a ruined fortune arrested him
in mid-career, put a stop to his favorite enterprise, and clouded
with poverty and adversity the evening of his days.</p>

<p>Among his public employments may be classed his mission
to Tennessee as the representative of the University in 1822.
The chief endowments of the University from the State consisted
in escheats, or the estates of persons dying without heirs
or next of kin, which passed to the State by a prerogative of
sovereignty. In her deed of cession to the United States of
her Tennessee territory, North Carolina had reserved the right
to satisfy the claims of her citizens for military service in the
army of the Revolution, by grants of land in the ceded territory,
and where her soldiers had died leaving no heirs, or none
who appeared and made claim within a limited period, their
titles were considered as escheats, and vested by law in the
Board of Trustees, and warrants were issued by the authorities
of North Carolina, in the names of such soldiers for the benefit
of the institution. The State of Tennessee took exception to
these proceedings of North Carolina, alleging that they were
in conflict with the provisions of the deed of cession, and, since
her admission into the Union, with her sovereign rights as an
independent State. The controversy became a serious one,
and Mr. Murphy was sent to confer with the Legislature of
Tennessee respecting it, in the year 1822. He was received
with the courtesy due to his high character and the important
interest he represented, and was heard upon the subject at the
bar of the Legislature on two successive days. An adjustment
of the dispute succeeded, by which a portion of the
claims of the University were yielded for the benefit of a similar
institution at Nashville, and the residue were confirmed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
From the sales of the lands thus acquired have arisen a large
portion of the investment in bank stocks, on which this institution
is at present maintained.</p>

<p>As a literary character Mr. Murphy deserves to be classed
among the first men of the State; and among those who, like
himself, devoted their time laboriously to professional and
public employments, he has had few superiors in literature
in the nation. In the Latin, Greek, and French languages
he attained such proficiency that till the close of his life he
read the standard authors with pleasure and for amusement,
and with the best of the English classics few were more familiar.
To this, though self-taught, he added no inconsiderable
attainments in science. As an epistolary writer he had
no equal among his contemporaries, and in all his compositions
there was an ease, simplicity, and at the same time an elegance
of expression which showed him to be master of his
native tongue. When it is known that a large part of his
life was passed in taverns, on the circuit, where he was immersed
in business&mdash;and when not so immersed, such was his
proverbial urbanity and kindliness of nature that his rooms
were the resort of all seeking advice and consultation, as well
as of his circle of friends in every county, attracted by the
charms of his conversation&mdash;his acquirements are a marvel to
those less studious or less imbued with a true love of letters.
His oration before the two Literary Societies of the University,
in 1827, is a fair exponent of his style of writing, and also indicates
his favorite studies, the subjects of his admiration, his
enthusiastic American sentiment, his characteristic benevolence
and kindness towards young men, and that unaffected
modesty which was so remarkable a virtue in his character.
Yet it is tinged with a vein of sadness, as if life for him was
approaching its twilight and he was walking among the graves
of the dead, some of them his comrades, whom he was soon to
follow. Notwithstanding it was the first in the series of these
discourses before the Societies, it has never been surpassed in
appropriateness and interest by those of any of his successors,
though among them have been many of the most distinguished
scholars in the State. Its commendation by Chief Justice
Marshall, in a letter to the author, published with the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
edition, stamps its portraits of public characters with his approbation
and renders it historical.</p>

<p>To the possession of genius in an eminent degree he united
some of its infirmities. A sanguine temper, a daring confidence
in results, a reliance on the apparent prosperity of the
times, involved him in pecuniary obligations, many of them,
perhaps, of a speculative character, which eventuated in disaster
and swept away his estate. A little later came an attack
of chronic rheumatism, from which he suffered much, and
was often incapacitated for business during the last half-dozen
years of his life. But during this season of adversity he struggled
with a brave heart against the storms of fate. With a
pallid cheek and disabled limbs he made his appearance in the
courts, where, as we have seen, his gifted mind occasionally
shone out in all its meridian splendor; and when this was not
practicable, the hours of pain and misfortune were beguiled, if
not solaced, by the pursuit of those noble studies which had
been the delight of his leisure in the days of his prosperity.</p>

<p>He died in Hillsborough, then his place of residence, on
February 3, 1832, and is interred in the graveyard of the
town, a few feet from the door of the Presbyterian church,
and nearly in front of it. No monument marks his resting-place.
His sons, Dr. V. Moreau Murphy, of Macon, Mississippi,
and Lieutenant P. U. Murphy, of the navy of the United
States, are his only surviving children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The work and worth and greatness of Murphy have never
been duly appreciated even in his own State; and yet, when
our history is written, if greatness is measured by the public
benefit it confers, perhaps Macon, Murphy, and Vance will
stand together as the three greatest men the State has yet
produced.</p>

<p>In common-sense statecraft, in the choice and application
of principles to existing conditions, and in the prophetic
knowledge of the fruit they would bring forth after their kind,
Macon was greatest. In scholarship and breadth of culture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
combined with originality to conceive the most far-reaching
policies of public welfare, Murphy was greatest. In the
knowledge of men, in his boundless wealth of human sympathy,
as the advocate and champion of the people's rights,
Vance was greatest. But Graham had a far greater knowledge
and grasp of the details of public business than any of
them; and Badger, in his ability to rapidly acquire and assimilate
law and learning, easily outstripped them all.</p>

<p>The sensibilities of Murphy were too refined for what is
called success in practical politics. His love and enthusiasm
for the public weal were so great that he forgot himself&mdash;but
let us never forget him.</p>

<p>If Murphy had lived to write, as he intended, the history
of North Carolina, he would have made all the world know
and acknowledge that some of her people began the Revolution
against British tyranny four years before the battle of
Lexington. Perhaps he would have made it too plain for cavil
that more than a year before Jefferson penned his immortal
document, the spirit that resisted Tryon had formed a government
at Charlotte independent of British rule, and that, in the
strongest probability, the authors of that government had
prepared the way for it by a declaration of independence.</p>

<p>Leavened by that spirit, the people of the whole State,
through their convention at Halifax, on May 12, 1776, proposed,
and on May 22 adopted, a resolution providing for
"declaring independence" in concurrence with the "other
colonies"&mdash;the first step taken in that direction by any of the
colonies.</p>

<p>Perhaps his clear voice could have been heard above the
conflicting jargon about the Regulators' War. The threadbare
statement that the spirit of these people was so thoroughly
crushed by Tryon's dress-parade campaign that they
all took sides with the British in the Revolutionary war might
have been thrashed a little thinner. Perhaps he would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
found at King's Mountain some of the fifteen hundred families
who fled west after the battle of Alamance.</p>

<p>Mrs. E. E. Moffitt of this city (a granddaughter of Judge
Murphy's sister, Mrs. John Daniel) is my authority for the
statement that Peter S. Ney&mdash;whom some believe to have
been none other than the great Marshal Ney&mdash;was Murphy's
amanuensis. It was a singular fate which drew these two
peculiar men of genius together.</p>

<p>There is grim humor in his pathetic attempt to enkindle
a love of history and education in this State by appealing to
the love of gain. His other scheme, internal improvements,
was equally chimerical; not because it lacked intrinsic merit,
but because the times and people had changed. He had not
calculated on the soporific effect of indirect taxes upon the
unpreferred States. It was too early for any but a prophet
to fully see that the States had dug the graves of their ultimate
autonomy by adopting a Constitution which forbade them "to
emit bills of credit"&mdash;a power of which they never stood in
dire need until the General Government had monopolized all
control of banking and currency.</p>

<p>No State, since the Union was formed, has, without Federal
aid, direct or indirect, made any material progress in developing
its resources!</p>

<h3><a name="ADDRESS" id="ADDRESS"></a>ADDRESS AT THE UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="center">BY ARCHIBALD D. MURPHY.</p>

<p>The Literary Societies of this institution have resolved that
an address be delivered before them annually by some one of
their members. This resolution, if carried into effect in the
spirit in which it has been adopted, will be creditable to the
Societies and favorable to the general literature of the State.
It is now more than thirty years since these Societies were
established, and all the <em>alumni</em> of this University have been
members of one or the other of them. Upon these <em>alumni</em>,
and upon others who shall go forth from this University, our
hopes must chiefly rest for improvement in our literary character;
and their zeal for such improvement cannot fail to be
excited by being annually called together, and one of them
selected to deliver a public discourse upon the progress and
state of our literature, or some subject connected therewith.
The Societies have conferred on me an unmerited honor by
appointing me to deliver the first of these discourses. I accepted
the appointment with pride, as it was an evidence of
their esteem; yet with humility, from a conviction of my inability
to meet public expectation&mdash;an inability of which I am
conscious at all times, but particularly so after a painful and
tedious illness.</p>

<p>Little that is interesting in the history of literature can be
expected in the infancy of a colony planted on a continent
three thousand miles distant from the mother-country, in the
midst of a wilderness and surrounded by savages. Under such
circumstances civilization declines, and manners and language
degenerate. When the first patent was granted to Sir Walter
Raleigh, in 1584, the English language had received considerable
improvement. Spenser had published his <cite>Faerie Queene</cite>,
Shakespeare his <cite>Plays</cite>, Sir Philip Sidney his <cite>Arcadia</cite>, Knolles
his <cite>General History of the Turks</cite>, and our theology had been
enriched by the eloquent writings of Hooker. This improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was not confined to the learned; it had already extended
itself to the common people, particularly in the towns and
villages, and the language of the first colonists no doubt partook
of this improvement. But these colonists were all adventurers;
they joined in Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition only
for the purpose of making fortunes, and their chief hope was
that they would quickly find gold in abundance and return
home to enjoy their wealth. This delusive hope continued
for many years to beguile adventurers; who, not finding the
treasure they came in quest of, became idle and profligate,
and abandoned a country in which they had met with nothing
but disappointment. Sir Walter Raleigh, after expending a
large part of his estate in attempts to settle a colony, assigned
to Thomas Smith, of London, and his associates, the privilege
of trading to Virginia and of continuing the colony. Under
the advice of Raleigh he directed his efforts to the waters of
the Chesapeake, and there caused to be planted a colony which
became permanent, and from which Virginia and Carolina
were peopled. A new charter was granted to Thomas Smith
and his associates in 1606, and enlarged in 1609. Their
company continued with many vicissitudes of fortune until
the year 1626, when it was dissolved. The history of the
colony to the time of this dissolution was written by John
Smith and also by Stith. They were contemporary with
Lord Clarendon, who wrote the <cite>History of the Great Rebellion</cite>
in England. Their style and manner of writing, and the
public papers published by the President and Council of the
Colony, during this period, evidence great improvement in
our language. The chaos in which it lay in the early part of
the reign of Elizabeth gradually gave way to the order and
method which good sense introduced into every pursuit; the
pedantry and conceits which disfigured our literature in the
reign of James I. yielded to the influence of good taste. Sir
Walter Raleigh published his <cite>History of the World</cite>, Lord
Bacon his historical and philosophical works and moral essays,
and our poetry was adorned by the writings of Milton, Dryden,
Butler, and Otway. Shortly afterwards came Sir William
Temple, Archbishop Tillotson and others, who gave facility
and grace to composition. These were new beauties and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
pleased the nation more as they gave to style the charm of
polished conversation.</p>

<p>Whilst the literary taste of the nation was thus improving,
religious intolerance drove from England a great number of
Quakers, Presbyterians and other sectarians, who sought
refuge in the Virginia colony. They there soon met with the
same persecution which had driven them from their native
country. They were compelled to leave the colony; and
Providence directing their course through the wilderness, they
settled near Pasquotank and Perquimans, and formed the
germ of the Carolina colony. Many of them were Quakers,
and their descendants continue to occupy that district of
country to this day.</p>

<p>In the year 1663, Charles II. granted the soil and seigniory
of Carolina to eight Lords Proprietors, who, to encourage emigration,
held out favorable terms. They promised to adventurers
gratuities in land according to the number of their respective
families, and the most perfect freedom in the exercise
of religion. A civil government was established purely
representative; a circumstance to which may be attributed, in
a great degree, the republican feelings and opinions which
soon characterized the colony, and which led to the plan of
civil polity under which we now live. When the Lords
Proprietors discovered that the colony was likely to become
numerous and powerful they endeavored to restrain the civil
and religious liberty which they had promised to emigrants:
they established a new form of government, declaring their
object to be "to make the government of the colony agree as
nearly as possible with the monarchy of which it was a part,
and to avoid erecting a numerous democracy." This plan of
government was the joint work of Lord Ashley and the celebrated
John Locke; and its chief aim was to appoint orders
of nobility, establish a powerful aristocracy and check the
progress of republican opinions and manners. A more ridiculous
plan for the government of the colony could not
have been devised. The people were accustomed to equality
and self-government; a rank of nobility was odious to them,
and they disregarded laws which they had not been consulted
in making. The prosperity of the colony declined, public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
morals relaxed, the laws lost their energy, a general spirit of
discontent grew up and ripened into rebellion; the Governors
became corrupt, and the people idle and vicious. The
attempt to give effect to the new plan of government entirely
failed, and the Lords Proprietors abolished it as unsuited
to the condition of the colony. Two factions then
arose; one that wished to establish a high-toned prerogative
government; the other consisted of High-churchmen, who
gained the ascendency, and by their violence brought the
government into contempt. Their object was to deprive all
dissenters of the right of suffrage, to curtail their civil rights,
and render their situation so oppressive as to compel them to
leave the colony. A party of French Huguenots had emigrated
to the colony to enjoy that liberty of conscience and of
worship which was denied to them in their native country.
These people, entitled by their sufferings no less than by their
Protestantism to the friendship and hospitality of the colonists,
were treated with a cruelty that disgraced the High-church
party. Being aliens, they were incapable of holding lands
until they were naturalized; and this party having the ascendency
in the Assembly, not only refused to naturalize them,
but declared their marriages by ministers not ordained by
Episcopal Bishops illegal and their children illegitimate. The
progress of this violent, persecuting spirit was checked by the
wise and conciliating measures adopted by Governor Archdale.
He assumed the government of the colony in 1695; he was a
Quaker, and possessed in an eminent degree the philanthropy
and command of temper for which this sect has been distinguished.
He was one of the Proprietors of the province,
and by the mere force of his character overawed the turbulent
and restored good order. To this excellent man our ancestors
are indebted for that tolerant provision in their militia
law which we still retain as part of our code, for granting
exemption to men who were restrained by religious principles
from bearing arms.</p>

<p>The religious intolerance of the High-church party was exerted
with new energy after the departure of Governor Archdale
from the province. This party passed laws, which the
Lords Proprietors ratified, to establish the Church of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and to disable dissenters from being members of the
Assembly. This was in direct violation of the chartered
rights of the colonists. The dissenters remonstrated to the
House of Lords; and Queen Anne, upon the advice of that
body, caused these laws to be repealed. But the High-church
party, steady to their purpose, varied their mode of attack;
the spirit of intolerance grew with the growth of the province;
emigrations from the Virginia colony and the patronage of the
Lords Proprietors gave to this party a decided majority in
the Assembly; they levied a tax on each precinct for the support
of a minister, and built churches. Protestant dissenters
were only permitted to worship in public, and there to be
subject to the rules and restrictions contained in the several
acts of Parliament. Quakers were permitted to affirm instead
of swearing; but they could not hold an office of profit or trust,
serve as jurors, or give evidence by affirmation in any criminal
case. This contest between the High-church party and the
dissenters produced an hostility of feeling which time has
softened, but which the lapse of more than a century has been
insufficient to allay. This contest, however, promoted freedom
of thought and inquiry among the people; it sharpened
their understandings, and in a great degree supplied the place
of books for instruction. At that time there were few books
in the colony: the library of a common man consisted of a
Bible and a spelling-book; the lawyers had a few books on
law, and the ministers a few on theological subjects, and sometimes
a few of the Greek and Roman classics: for they, particularly
the Presbyterian ministers, were generally school-masters&mdash;and
from them the poor young men of the colony,
who wished to preach the gospel or plead law, received their
humble education. The turbulent spirit of the colonists,
their leaning towards republicanism and sectarianism, had induced
the Lords Proprietors to forbid the establishment of
printing presses in the colony; and Sir William Berkeley, who
had the superintendence of this colony in 1661, gave thanks
to heaven that there was not a printing office in any of the
Southern provinces.</p>

<p>What improvement in literature could be expected among
a people who were thus distracted by faction, destitute of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
books, and denied the use of the press? Notwithstanding all
these discouragements and disadvantages, however, the literature
of the colony evidently advanced. The public papers
of that period are written in a conspicuous, nervous style, corresponding
in force of expression, purity of language and perspicuity
of arrangement, with similar writings in the reigns
of Charles II., King William, and Queen Anne. The intelligence
of the common people and the ability and learning
of the men who managed the affairs of the colony in that
period are matters of surprise and astonishment to any one
acquainted with the disadvantages under which the colony
labored. The Assembly and the courts of justice sat in private
houses; the acts passed by the Assembly were not printed; they
were read aloud to the people at the first court after they were
passed; they were in force for only two years, and every biennial
Assembly was under the necessity of reenacting all that
were thought useful. There was no printing press in the
colony before the year 1746, at which time the condition of
the statute-book required a revisal, and the public interest
called aloud for the printing of it. The learning and literature
of the colony were confined to the lawyers and ministers
of the gospel, most of whom were educated in England; and
it was owing to this circumstance chiefly that the literature of
the colony advanced so steadily with that of the mother-country.</p>

<p>The legislation of the colony began to assume form and
system in the reign of Queen Anne; and in the year after
her death, 1715, the Assembly passed sixty-six acts, most of
which had been frequently reenacted before. Many of those
acts remain in force to this day, and are monuments of the
political wisdom and legal learning of that time. In style
and composition they are equal to any part of our statute-book;
they are the first statutes of the colony that have come down
to our time.</p>

<p>In the year 1729 the Lords Proprietors, with the exception
of Lord Granville, surrendered to the Crown their right to
the soil and seigniory of North Carolina; and from that time
the population and prosperity of the colony rapidly increased.
But in a few years the great contest commenced between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
prerogative of the Crown and the liberty of the colonial subject,
which contest eventually terminated in the American
Revolution. This contest gradually introduced into North
Carolina, and into all the British colonies which took part
in it, a style in composition which distinguishes this period
from all others in English or American literature: a style
founded upon and expressive of exalted feeling. Education
embellished it and gave to it new beauties; but its force and
impressive character were perceptible in the writings and
speeches of ordinary men. What age or nation ever produced
compositions superior to the addresses of the Continental
Congress? When or where shall we find a parallel to the
correspondence of General Washington and the general officers
of the American army? The style of these addresses
and of the correspondence is the style of high thought and
of lofty, yet chastened feeling, and reminds the reader of the
finest specimens of composition in Tacitus, and of the correspondence
of Cicero and his friends after the death of
Pompey.</p>

<p>There is something in the style and sentiment of the writings
of this period which gives to them a magic charm, and
seems to consecrate the subjects on which it is employed&mdash;a
something connected with the finest perceptions of our nature.
The reader is every moment conscious of it, yet knows not
how to explain it. The high moral feeling and virtuous sympathy
which characterized the American Revolution have
given to it a hallowedness of character. It is fortunate for
us that Chief Justice Marshall has written the history of this
Revolution. Whatever may be the defects of this work, the
history of our Revolution will never be so well written again:
no work on that subject so well calculated to produce an useful
effect upon its readers will ever appear. Marshall was a
soldier of the Revolution, and possessed the finest genius; he
was the personal friend of the Commander-in-chief; partook of
all the feelings of the officers of the army; and he has transfused
into his work that exalted sentiment which animated
his compatriots in arms. This sentiment is strongly portrayed
in the writings of the Marquis de Chastellux and Count
Rochambeau, two French general officers in the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
service, and in the correspondence of the Commander-in-chief
and the American general officers. But it can never be embodied
into an historical work by a man who did not feel it
in all its force in the American camp. Literary elegance
disappears before such moral beauty. There is no historical
work in any language that can be read with so much advantage,
such moral effect, by American youth, as Marshall's <cite>Life
of George Washington</cite>. They should read it with diligence,
and read it often. They will never rise from the perusal of
it without feeling fresh incentives both to public and private
virtue.</p>

<p>The progress of the style which marked the period of the
American Revolution may be traced in North Carolina from
the administration of Governor Dobbs. It had become the
common style of the leading men of the colony before the
meeting of the Continental Congress in 1774. The correspondence
and public papers of Samuel Johnston and Joseph
Hewes, of Edenton; of William Hooper and Archibald Maclaine,
of Wilmington; of Richard Caswell, of Kinston; of
Thomas Burke, of Hillsborough; of Francis and Abner Nash
of New Bern, upon the great subjects which then engrossed
the public attention, do honor to the literature of North Carolina
at that time. They wrote upon matters of business&mdash;business
which concerned the welfare of the nation; they wrote
as they felt; and their compositions, coming warm from the
heart, are free from affectation or pedantry, and equally free
from that prolixity which is the vice of modern composition.</p>

<p>When these men disappeared, our literature, in a great
degree, disappeared with them. The war had exhausted the
resources of the State and ruined the fortunes of many individuals;
we had no schools for the education of our youth;
few of our citizens were able to send their sons to the Northern
colleges or to Europe to be educated. Two individuals, who
received their education during the war, were destined to keep
alive the remnant of our literature and prepare the public
mind for the establishment of this University. These were
William R. Davie and Alfred Moore. Each of them had endeared
himself to his country by taking an active part in the
latter scenes of the war; and when public order was restored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and the courts of justice were opened they appeared at the
bar, where they quickly rose to eminence, and for many years
shone like meteors in North Carolina. They adorned the
courts in which they practiced, gave energy to the laws, and
dignity to the administration of justice. Their genius was
different and so was their eloquence. Davie took Lord
Bolingbroke for his model, and Moore, Dean Swift; and
each applied himself with so much diligence to the study
of his model that literary men could easily recognize in the
eloquence of Davie the lofty, flowing style of Bolingbroke;
and in that of Moore, the plainness and precision of Swift
&mdash;they roused the ambition of parents and their sons; they
excited emulation among ingenuous youth; they depicted in
glowing colors the necessity of establishing a public school
or university in which the young men of the State could
be educated. The General Assembly resolved to found an
university. I was present in the House of Commons when
Davie addressed that body upon the bill granting a loan of
money to the trustees for erecting the buildings of this
University; and although more than thirty years have since
elapsed, I have the most vivid recollections of the greatness
of his manner and the power of his eloquence upon
that occasion. In the House of Commons he had no rival,
and upon all great questions which came before that body
his eloquence was irresistible. The genius and intellectual
habits of Moore fitted him for the bar rather than a deliberative
assembly. Public opinion was divided upon the
question whether he or Davie excelled at the bar. Moore
was a small man, neat in his dress and graceful in his manners;
his voice was clear and sonorous, his perceptions quick, and
his judgment almost intuitive; his style was chaste and his
manner of speaking animated. Having adopted Swift for his
model, his language was always plain. The clearness and
energy of his mind enabled him, almost without an effort, to
disentangle the most intricate subject and expose it in all its
parts to the simplest understanding. He spoke with ease and
with force, enlivened his discourses with flashes of wit, and
where the subject required it, with all the bitterness of sarcasm.
His speeches were short and impressive: when he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
down every one thought he had said everything that he ought
to have said. Davie was in his person tall and elegant,
graceful and commanding in his manners; his voice was mellow
and adapted to the expression of every passion; his mind
was comprehensive, yet slow in its operations, when compared
with his great rival. His style was magnificent and flowing,
and he had a greatness of manner in public speaking which
suited his style and gave to his speeches an imposing effect.
He was a laborious student, arranged his discourses with care,
and, where the subject suited his genius, poured forth a torrent
of eloquence that astonished and enraptured his audience.
They looked upon him with delight, listened to his long, harmonious
periods, caught his emotions, and indulged that
ecstasy of feeling which fine speaking and powerful eloquence
alone can produce. He is certainly to be ranked among the
first orators, and his rival, Moore, among the first advocates,
which the American nation has produced.</p>

<p>Whilst these two men were in the zenith of their glory, another
man arose at the bar in North Carolina who surpassed
them both in profoundness of legal learning, and, on many
occasions, successfully contended with them for the palm of
forensic eloquence. This was the late John Haywood. He
had few advantages from nature; his person was indifferent,
his voice harsh, his manners uncouth, his education limited.
He was a stranger to the graces, and had few of the accomplishments
of an orator. But he had a powerful and intrepid
mind, which he cultivated by the most laborious study. The
fame of Davie and Moore inspired his ambition, and he was
tortured by a desire of entering the lists with these champions
of the bar. He was conscious of his defects, and sought to
gain the ascendency by superior legal learning. He came to
the bar with confidence of high intellectual powers and profound
knowledge of the law; and in a little time acquired a
reputation that placed him at the head of his profession in this
State and gave him rank among the ablest common-law
lawyers in the Union.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Haywood were several gentlemen of
the bar now living and several who are dead who have sustained
the character of their profession for legal learning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
general literature. Among the latter were William Duffy
and Archibald Henderson. Duffy was the child of misfortune.
Thrown upon the world without friends and without
fortune, accident introduced him, in his early youth, to the
acquaintance of John Haywood, Esq., the venerable Treasurer
of this State, who, in the exercise of that benevolence
for which his whole life has been conspicuous, gave him employment
and enabled him to prosecute his studies and prepare
himself for the bar. Duffy had an opportunity of witnessing
the splendid displays of Davie and Moore and he
profited by their example. He devoted a large portion of his
time to polite literature, and acquired a more elegant style in
composition than any of his contemporaries in North Carolina.
He had a slight impediment in his speech, but by laborious
perseverance he succeeded in regulating the tones and modulations
of his voice in such a way that his impediment seemed
to be an ornament to his delivery. He was one of the few
men of our country who could read well; he studied the art
of reading, and his friends will long remember the pleasure
they have received from hearing him read. In his addresses
at the bar he was always impressive, particularly upon topics
connected with virtuous and benevolent feeling. He had a
vigorous mind and feelings attuned to the finest emotions. I
remember him with fond affection. He was my friend, my
preceptor, my patron. He instructed me in the science of the
law, in the art of managing causes at the bar, and in the still
more difficult art of reading books to advantage. I wish it
were in my power to render to his memory a more permanent
honor than this passing tribute of respect and gratitude!</p>

<p>Henderson survived Duffy many years, and obtained the
first standing at the bar of this State. He was devoted to his
profession, and, upon the whole, was the most perfect model
of a lawyer that our bar has produced. It was late in life
before he turned his attention to polite literature, and he never
acquired a good style in composition. Yet his style and manner
of speaking at the bar were extremely impressive. I shall
here speak of him as I did in a sketch of his character published
shortly after his death. In him the faculties of a fine
mind were blended with exalted moral feelings. Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
he was at all times accessible, he seemed to live and move in
an atmosphere of dignity. He exacted nothing by his manner,
yet all approached him with reverence and left him with
respect. The little quarrels and contests of men were beneath
him; his was the region of high sentiment, and there
he occupied a standing that was preeminent. The Constitution
and jurisprudence of his country were his favorite studies.
Profound reflection had generalized his ideas and given to his
political and legal learning a scientific cast. No man better
understood the theory of our government; no man more admired
it, and no man gave more practical proofs of his admiration.
The sublime idea that he lived under a government
of laws was forever uppermost in his mind, and seemed to give
a coloring to all his actions. As he acknowledged no dominion
but that of the laws, he bowed with reverence to their
authority, and taught obedience no less by his example than
his precept. To the humble officer of justice he was respectful;
the vices of private character were overlooked when the
individual stood before him clothed with judicial authority.
In the County Courts, where the justices of the peace administer
the law, he was no less respectful in his deportment than
in the highest tribunal of the State. He considered obedience
to the laws to be the first duty of a citizen, and it seemed to
be the great object of his professional life to inculcate a sense
of this duty and give to the administration of the laws an
impressive character. He was conscious of his high standing,
and never committed himself nor put his reputation at risk.
He always came to the trial of his causes well prepared; and
if the state of his health or his want of preparation were likely
to jeopardize his reputation in the management of his client's
cause he would decline the trial until a more favorable time.
The courts in which he practiced, and his brother lawyers,
understood the delicacy of his feelings upon this point so well
that they extended to him the indulgence he required, and a
knowledge of this part of his character gave confidence to his
clients and attracted crowds of people to hear his speeches.
When he rose at the bar no one expected to hear common-place
matter; no one looked for a cold, vapid, or phlegmatic
harangue. His great excellence as a speaker consisted in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
earnestness and dignity of manner and strong powers of
reasoning. He seized one or two strong points, and these he
illustrated and enforced. His exordium was short and appropriate;
he quickly marched up to the great point in controversy,
making no manœuvre as if he were afraid to approach
it, or was desirous of attacking it by surprise. The confidence
he exhibited of success he gradually imparted to his
hearers; he grew more warm and earnest as he advanced in
his argument, and seizing the critical moment for enforcing
conviction, he brought forth his main argument, pressed it
home and sat down. As he advanced in life he seemed more
and more anxious that the laws should be interpreted and
administered by the rules of common sense. He lost his reverence
for artificial rules; he said the laws were made for the
people, and they should be interpreted and administered by
rules which the people understood, whenever it was practicable;
that common sense belonged to the people in a higher
degree than to learned men, and that to interpret laws by
rules which were at variance with the rules of common sense
necessarily lessened the respect of the people for the laws, and
induced them to believe that courts and lawyers contrived
mysteries in the science merely for the purpose of supporting
the profession of lawyers. He said the rules of pedantry did
not suit this country nor this age; that common sense had
acquired dominion in politics and religion, and was gaining it
in the law; that judges and lawyers should have the independence
and magnanimity to strip off the veil of mystery from
every branch of the science, and simplify and make it intelligible,
as far as possible, to the understanding of the common
people.</p>

<p>In all free States eloquence has preceded poetry, history,
and philosophy. By opening the road to wealth and fame it
subserves the purposes of avarice and ambition; society is led
captive by its charms, and sometimes bound in fetters by its
powers. In this State the bar and the General Assembly have
been thus far the theatres for its display. Oratory is the
branch of literature which we have cultivated with most success,
and in which we have not been far behind any of our
sister States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long after Davie left the House of Commons there
appeared in that body another man whose genius we have
all admired and whose misfortune we all deplore. I hope I
may be permitted to speak of him, although he be still living.
Providence has withdrawn him from public view, and he has
been followed by the regrets and tears of his countrymen.
I speak of John Stanly, Esq. For more than twenty years
he has been the ornament of the bar and of the House
of Commons. Small in stature, neat in dress, graceful in
manner, with a voice well modulated, and a mind intrepid,
disciplined and rich in knowledge, he became the most accomplished
orator of the State. His style of eloquence was more
varied than that of any of his predecessors. Such were the
versatility of his genius and the extent of his acquirements
that he could at pleasure adopt the lofty, flowing style of
Davie, or the plain, simple, energetic style of Moore. He
could rouse the noble passions, or amuse by his wit and pleasantry.
He excelled in appropriate pauses, emphasis and gesticulation.
No speaker was ever more fortunate in accommodating
his manner to his subject; and on all important subjects
he had a greatness of manner which small men seldom acquire.
He resembled Moore in the quickness of his perceptions and
the intuition of his judgment. His talents and knowledge
were always at command, and he could bring them to bear
with force and effect as occasion required, without any preparation.
His mind was so well disciplined and so happily toned
that it was always ready for action. He possessed the rare
talent of conversing well; his conversation was the perpetual
flow of sober thought or pleasant humor, and was heightened
in its effect by his happy style and gracefulness of manner.
He was among the few orators of this or any country, whose
style and manner in conversation equaled his style and manner
in public speaking.</p>

<p>Few of the men whom I have named had the advantage of
a liberal education; they rose to eminence by the force of
genius and a diligent application to their studies. The number
of our literary men has been small, when compared with
our population; but this is not a matter of surprise when we
look to the condition of the State since the close of the Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
war. When the war ended the people were in poverty,
society in disorder, morals and manners almost prostrate.
Order was to be restored to society and energy to the laws
before industry could repair the fortunes of the people; schools
were to be established for the education of youth and congregations
formed for preaching the gospel before the public
morals could be amended. Time was required to effect these
objects; and the most important of them, the education of
youth, was the longest neglected. Before this University
went into operation, in 1795, there were not more than three
schools in the State in which the rudiments of a classical
education could be acquired. The most prominent and useful
of these schools was kept by Dr. David Caldwell, of Guilford
county. He instituted it shortly after the close of the war
and continued it for more than thirty years. The usefulness
of Dr. Caldwell to the literature of North Carolina will never
be sufficiently appreciated; but the opportunities of instruction
in his school were very limited. There was no library
attached to it; his students were supplied with a few of the
Greek and Latin classics, <cite>Euclid's Elements of Mathematics</cite>,
and <cite>Martin's Natural Philosophy</cite>. Moral philosophy was
taught from a syllabus of lectures delivered by Dr. Witherspoon
at Princeton College. The students had no books on
history or miscellaneous literature. There were indeed very
few in the State, except in the libraries of lawyers who lived
in the commercial towns. I well remember that after completing
my course of studies under Dr. Caldwell, I spent
nearly two years without finding any books to read except some
old works on theological subjects. At length, I accidentally
met with Voltaire's history of Charles XII. of Sweden, an
odd volume of Smollett's <cite>Roderick Random</cite>, and an abridgment
of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>. These books gave me a taste for reading,
which I had no opportunity of gratifying until I became
a student in this University in the year 1796. Few of Dr.
Caldwell's students had better opportunities for getting books
than myself; and with these slender opportunities of instruction,
it is not surprising that so few became eminent in the
liberal professions. At this day, when libraries are established
in all our towns, when every professional man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
every respectable gentleman has a collection of books, it is
difficult to conceive the inconveniences under which young
men labored thirty or forty years ago.</p>

<p>But has the number of our distinguished men increased as
the facilities of instruction have increased? They certainly
have not. Of the number of young men who have been educated
at this University, how few have risen to eminence in
any branch of literature! Their number bears no proportion
to the increased means of instruction which they have had.
To what causes is this to be attributed? The causes are numerous,
but we will notice only a few of the most operative.
In the first place the plan of education in all our schools, particularly
in our preparatory schools, is radically defective;
too much time is spent upon syntax and etymology; the time
of the student is wasted, and his genius frittered away upon
words instead of being developed and polished by the spirit
of the writer. Instead of directing the study of the Greek
and Latin classics to the development of his faculties and the
improvement of his taste, his time is taken up in nice attention
to words, arrangement of clauses and construction of periods.
With his mind thus injured, he enters upon the study of the
physical and moral sciences, and long accustomed to frivolous
investigation, he never rises to the dignity of those sciences
nor understands the methods by which their truths are illustrated.
In the next place, too many studies are crowded upon
the student at once; studies which have no analogy or connection.
In the third place, the time allotted for completing a
course of scientific study is too short; the student's mind flags
under the severe labors imposed upon it. The elasticity of
the mind ought never to be weakened; if it be, the student
thenceforward hobbles through his course, and is often broken
down before he gets to the end of it. In the fourth place,
too many studies are pursued, and none are pursued well; the
student acquires a smattering of languages and sciences, and
understands none of them. This encyclopedical kind of learning
is destructive of the powers of the mind, and unfits it for
deep and severe investigation. In the last place, the multitude
of books is a serious injury to most students. They despair
of reading many of them, and content themselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
reading reviews of the most celebrated. At length the valuable
books are placed away carefully in a library, and newspapers,
pamphlets and other fugitive productions take up all
their time for reading. There is nothing in this course which
teaches youth how to think and investigate. The great object
of education is to give to the mind activity and energy: this
object can never be attained by a course of studies which
distracts its attention and impairs its elasticity.</p>

<p>The evils which I have mentioned are not confined to the
schools of North Carolina; they exist in nearly all the schools
of the Union. Massachusetts has taken the lead in correcting
them and introducing methods of instruction founded upon
the philosophy of the mind. The state of science and literature
among her people shows the happy effect of these changes.
The Trustees of this University have resolved to make similar
changes, to remodel the plan of studies, and introduce new
methods of instruction. But whatever changes may be made
in our plan of education, young men, who are desirous of
being either useful or eminent in active life, should recollect
this truth, that the education received at a college or university
is intended only as a preparation of the mind for receiving
the rich stores of science and general knowledge which subsequent
industry is to acquire. He who depends upon this
preparation alone will be like a farmer who ploughs his land
and sows no grain. The period of useful study commences
when a young man finishes his collegiate course. At that
time his faculties have acquired some maturity from age and
some discipline from exercise; and if he enter with diligence
upon the study of a branch of science, and confines his attention
to that branch, he soon becomes astonished at his progress
and at the increase of his intellectual powers. Let him avoid
reading or even looking into a variety of books. Nine-tenths
of them are worse than useless; the reading of them produces
a positive injury to the mind; they not only distract his attention,
but blunt his faculties. Let him read only works of men
of genius&mdash;read but few books, and read them often. Take
two young men of equal minds and similar genius; put into
the hands of one Shakespeare's <cite>Plays</cite>, Milton's <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,
<cite>Don Quixote</cite> and <cite>Gil Blas</cite>; and into the hands of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
all the hundred volumes of dullness which fill our libraries;
and at the end of twelve months mark the difference between
them. The first will be like the high-spirited steed that is
ready for the course; the other will be encumbered with a
load of useless ideas, his faculties weakened, and the bright
tints of his genius obscured.</p>

<p>The next great object, after the improvement of the intellectual
faculties, is the forming of a moral character. This
is by far the most difficult part of education: it depends upon
the doctrines of morals and the philosophy of the passions and
feelings. Little success has heretofore attended it, either in
the schools of Europe or this country. The moral character
of youth has been generally formed by their parents, by
friends who gained their confidence, or by their pursuits in
active life. The morality thus taught is purely practical; it
has reference to no abstract truths; it looks only to the passions
and feelings of our nature under the variety of circumstances
in which we may be placed in society, and the duties which
thence result. The science of ethics taught in our schools is
a cold, speculative science; and our youth are misled by substituting
this for practical morality. It is to be regretted
that we have no work on moral philosophy which treats of
ethics purely as a practical science; and it is remarkable that,
notwithstanding the great improvement that has been made
within the last century in metaphysical and physical science,
and the liberal turn of philosophical inquiry which has been
introduced, the science of ethics remains stationary. The
question, "What is the foundation of moral obligation?" is
not more satisfactorily answered now than it was two centuries
ago. And until the principles of ethics shall be disentangled
from the speculative doctrines of theology, interwoven by the
schoolmen and monks in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and those principles be traced to the constitution and condition
of man, having for their object the development of his
social rights and duties, we shall have to regret that the most
sublime of all the sciences remains imperfect. It seems to be
reserved for the philosophers of Scotland to trace those principles
and make this development; and we wait with impatience
for the promised work of Dugald Stewart on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
subject. But any system of morals which we may study as
a science will never have much effect in forming our moral
character. We must look to our constitutional temperament,
to our passions and feelings as influenced by external circumstances;
and for rules of conduct we must look to the sermons
and parables of Christ: they are worth more than all the books
which have been written on morals; they explain and at the
same time apply that pure morality which is founded upon
virtuous feeling.</p>


<p><i>Young Gentlemen of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies</i>:</p>

<p>As you have conferred on me the honor of delivering this
first public address under your joint resolution, I hope you
will permit me before I sit down to say a few words upon a
subject connected with the usefulness of your Societies and
the interests of the University. I speak to you in the spirit
of fellowship, and a long acquaintance with your Societies
enables me to speak with confidence. I well know the influence
which your Societies can exercise in maintaining the
good order of this Institution, in sustaining the authority of
the faculty, in suppressing vice and promoting a gentlemanly
deportment among the students. Every respectable student
of proper age is a member of one or the other of your Societies,
and feels more mortification at incurring its censure than that
of the faculty. This feeling is the fulcrum on which the power
of the Societies ought to be exerted. Let me entreat you
then, more particularly as you propose hereafter to occupy
a higher ground than you have heretofore done, to exert that
power in sustaining the discipline of the University, in encouraging
industry and good manners, and in suppressing
vice. The united efforts of the two Societies can do more in
effecting these objects than the authority of the Trustees or
faculty. A high responsibility rests upon you; your honor
and the welfare of the University demand its faithful discharge.</p>

<p>In a short time you will complete your course of studies at
this place and bid adieu to these halls, to act your parts upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the great theatre of active life. Your friends and your
country have much to hope, much to expect from you. Devote
yourselves with diligence to your studies. When you shall
have finished your course here, remember that your education
is just commencing; I mean that education which is to fit
you for acting a distinguished part upon the theatre of your
country. The pursuits and the honors of literature lie in the
same road with those of ambition; and he who aspires to
fame or distinction must rest his hopes upon the improvement
of his intellect. Julius Caesar was one of the most accomplished
scholars of Rome, and Napoleon Bonaparte of France.
In our own country we lately have seen one of our most eminent
scholars raised to the chief magistracy of the nation, and
the greatest orator of the age made his prime minister. I
speak not here of politics: literature has no factions; good taste
no parties. Remember, my young friends, that most of the
men who thus far have shed a lustre upon our country had
not one-half the opportunities of education which you have
enjoyed. They had to rely upon their genius and industry.
Genius delights to toil with difficulties: they discipline its powers
and animate its courage; it contemns the honors which can
be obtained without labor, and prizes only those which are
purchased by noble exertion. Wish not, therefore, for a life
of ease; but go forth with stout hearts and determined resolution.
As yet you little know what labor and perseverance
can effect, nor the exalted pleasures which honorable exertion
gives to an ingenious mind. May God take charge of you;
lead you in the ways of uprightness and honor; make you all
useful men, and ornaments to your country!</p>


<h3>LETTER FROM CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MURPHY.</h3>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Richmond</span>, October 6, 1827.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Your oration, delivered in Person Hall,
Chapel Hill, reached this place during a visit I had made to
our mountain country. It was taken out of the post-office
and placed on a general table, among a number of papers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pamphlets received during my absence, and was not perceived
till to-day. I mention this circumstance as an apology for
having permitted so much time to elapse without making any
acknowledgments for the gratification derived from its perusal.</p>

<p>I take a great deal of interest in your portraits of the eminent
men of North Carolina, who have now passed away from
the theatre of action. It was my happiness to be acquainted
with those of whom you speak as being known to yourself,
and I feel the justness of the eulogies you have bestowed upon
them. I never heard Mr. Davie nor Mr. Moore at the bar,
but the impressions they both made upon me in private circles
were extremely favorable, and I think you have given to the
character of each its true coloring. Neither have I ever
heard Mr. Stanly, but I have known him also in private, and
it was not possible to be in his company without noticing and
being struck with his general talent, and most especially his
vivacity, his wit, and his promptness. He appeared to be
eminently endowed with a ready elocution, and almost intuitive
perception of the subjects of discussion. With Mr.
Haywood and Mr. Henderson I was well acquainted, and have
heard them often at the bar. They were unquestionably
among the ablest lawyers of their day. I saw not much of
Mr. Duffy as a professional man, but thought him a pleasing,
agreeable gentleman. You omitted one name which ranks,
I think, among the considerable men of your State. It is
that of the late Judge Iredell. I was well acquainted with
him too, and always thought him a man of real talent.</p>

<p>In the rapid sketch you have taken of the colonial government,
some circumstances excite a good deal of surprise. The
persecuting spirit of the High-church party was still more
vindictive than I had supposed, and the principle of limiting
your laws to two years was, I believe, peculiar to Carolina.
The scarcity of books, too, which seems to have prevailed ever
since the Revolution, is a very remarkable fact. Although
I concur perfectly in the opinion you express that much more
advantage is to be derived from the frequent and attentive
perusal of a few valuable books, than from indiscriminate and
multifarious reading&mdash;that cramming injures digestion&mdash;yet,
some books are necessary, not only for ornament, but for use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Allow me to thank you for the pleasure I have received
from the perusal of your oration, for I must suppose that I am
indebted to yourself for this mark of polite attention, and to
express my particular acknowledgments for the flattering
notice you have taken of the <cite>Life of George Washington</cite>.
That work was hurried into the world with too much precipitation,
but I have lately given it a careful examination and
correction. Should another edition appear it will be less
fatiguing and more worthy of the character which the biographer
of Washington ought to sustain.</p>

<p>With very great respect and esteem, I am, sir,</p>

<p>William Gaston, late one of the Judges of the Supreme
Court of North Carolina, was born in the town of New
Bern on the 19th day of September, A. D. 1778. His
paternal ancestors were distinguished French Huguenots, who
were driven from their country by the revocation of the
famous edict of Nantes, and retired to Ballymore, in Ireland,
where they settled, and where Alexander Gaston, the father of
the Judge, was born. Alexander, having chosen the profession
of medicine and obtained his diploma at the medical college
of Edinburgh, entered the British navy as a surgeon.
After remaining a few years in this service, he resigned his
commission and came to New Bern in this State, where he
settled and commenced the regular practice of his profession.
In the year 1775 he married Margaret Sharpe, an English
lady of the Roman Catholic faith, by whom he had two sons
and a daughter, of whom the Judge was the second son. The
elder brother died young; and before the subject of this
sketch was three years of age he lost his father in a manner
deeply tragical. He was shot by a band of Tories, who, in
the year 1781, surprised the town of New Bern, and singled
out the doctor, who was an ardent and active Whig, as an
especial object of their vengeance. It is said that the fatal
instrument of death was fired over the head of the agonized
wife, while she was imploring, as only a woman can implore,
the life of her husband. The Judge was then doubtless too
young to appreciate all the horrors of the scene, but that it
made a deep impression upon him in subsequent life we are
well assured. Many years afterwards, while he was a member
of Congress, upon being charged, in an exciting party debate,
with a want of proper American feeling, he indignantly repelled
the imputation by the eloquent exclamation, "I was
baptized an American in the blood of a murdered father."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
That same incident was alluded to with thrilling effect in the
convention called to amend the Constitution in 1835 by the
distinguished and venerable president of that body. The
death of his father threw upon his mother the entire care
and responsibility of rearing and educating her infant children.
Her situation was peculiarly beset with difficulties.
The death of two brothers, with whom she had come to this
country, followed by the loss of her husband, left her without
any other relatives in America than her two children. But
happily for them, she was a woman of great energy of character,
of singular prudence, and of devoted piety. It immediately
became a leading object of her life to train up her son
to usefulness and honor. We may be well assured from its
results, that her course of discipline was eminently judicious.
Indeed, the Judge has been heard to declare that whatever
success and distinction he had attained in life he owed
to her counsels and her admirable management, and that but
for her he might have been a vagabond. He was first sent to
school in his native town, and while there he was represented
as having been "very quick, and apt to learn; of an affectionate
temper, and yet volatile and irritable. His mother used
every means to correct his infirmities of disposition, and to give
an aim to his pursuits&mdash;sometimes employing kindness, or
mild but solemn admonition, and occasionally still stricter
discipline." She kept him under her own immediate supervision
and control until the fall of the year 1791, when she
sent him to the Roman Catholic college at Georgetown.
After remaining at this institution about eighteen months,
his failing health compelled him to return home. Soon afterwards
his health was reestablished, and he resumed his studies
under the tuition of the Rev. Thomas P. Irving, who then
had charge of the academy at New Bern. Here he was prepared
for admission into the junior class of Princeton College,
which he entered in the fall of 1794; and in 1796 was graduated,
at the early age of eighteen, with the first honors of the
institution.</p>

<p>After completing his collegiate course he selected the law
as his profession, and immediately commenced his studies in
the office of François Xavier Martin, then a practicing lawyer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
in this State, but now a Judge of the Supreme Court of the
State of Louisiana. The same diligent attention to the studies
of his profession, which had distinguished his career in college,
enabled him to obtain admittance to the bar in the year 1798.
In that same year the late Chief Justice Taylor, who had married
his sister, was elevated to the bench and gave all his business
to his young friend and relative, which put him at once
into full practice. This sudden accumulation of business,
which would have operated to the disadvantage of a mind less
active and cultivated, served only to call forth all his energies,
by the necessity it occasioned of a thorough preparation to
meet the great responsibility thrown upon him. He very soon
acquired distinction in his profession, which steadily increased
until he attained, by universal acknowledgment, the proud
eminence of being at the head of the bar of this State&mdash;a
pre-eminence which he never lost until he was raised by his
admiring countrymen to a still more exalted station. But
while he was thus pursuing, with rare success, the profits and
honors of his profession, he never for a moment lost sight of
the interests of his country. The very next year after he
reached the age of manhood he was elected a member of the
State Senate from his native county of Craven; and in 1808
he was elected a member of the House of Commons, and was
chosen to preside over its deliberations. The same year he
was nominated by the Federal party, to which he was attached,
as Presidential Elector for the district in which he resided.
The reputation which he had acquired at the bar and in the
legislative halls of the State for integrity, patriotism and distinguished
ability procured his election in 1813, and again in
1815, to the House of Representatives in the Congress of the
United States. Of the elevated stand which he took in that
body it is needless for me here to speak. It is a part of the
history of the country, that amidst the brilliant constellation
of statesmen then seen in the councils of the American nation&mdash;a
constellation illustrated by the genius and eloquence of a
Lowndes, a Randolph, a Calhoun, a Webster, and a Clay, the
star of Gaston was far from being the least brilliant. The admirer
of parliamentary oratory will find in his speeches upon
the Loan Bill and the previous question some of the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
displays of reasoning and eloquence which our country has
produced.</p>

<p>In 1817, Judge Gaston voluntarily retired from Congress,
and never returned to the national councils. The residue of
his days he devoted to the duties of domestic and professional
life, and to the service of his native State. He was frequently
chosen, sometimes by the freemen of the county of Craven,
and sometimes by those of the town of New Bern, to represent
them in the General Assembly. Of the value of his services
in this more limited, but still very important sphere of usefulness,
it is difficult to speak in adequate terms without the
appearance of exaggeration. I have not the materials, if I
had the time and opportunity, for stating in detail all the
measures which he accomplished, or assisted in accomplishing,
for the good of the State. I can point only to a few monuments
in the course of our legislative history, to show that
the hand of a master-workman has been there. In the year
1808 he drew up the "Act regulating the descent of inheritances,"
which, with scarcely any alteration or addition, remains
the law on that subject to this day. In 1818 he was
mainly instrumental in the establishment of our present Supreme
Court system; and in 1828 all his varied powers of
eloquence and argumentation were exerted to their utmost to
prevent the success of a measure in relation to the banks,
which would have spread ruin and dismay throughout the
length and breadth of our State. His last appearance in the
Legislature was as a member of the House of Commons in
1831 when he made a splendid effort, but all in vain, in favor
of rebuilding the capitol, which had been destroyed by fire the
preceding summer.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1833 a vacancy upon the bench of the
Supreme Court occurred by the death of Chief Justice Henderson.
From various causes, of which I know too little to
attempt an explanation, the Supreme Court had at that time
by no means so strong a hold upon the confidence of the people
as it has since obtained. It was very desirable, therefore, on
the part of the friends of the system to fill the vacancy by a
man of commanding talents and great influence, in order to
give it strength. All eyes were at once turned towards Judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Gaston. But there were supposed to be two very serious obstacles
to his acceptance of the office. It was known that his
practice at the bar was extensive and very lucrative, and it was
also known that a prudent regard to his private affairs would
dictate that his professional income should not be exchanged
for a judge's salary. It was also believed by many that the
thirty-second article of our State Constitution forbade his
accepting the office, in that clause which declared that "no
person who shall deny the truth of the Protestant religion shall
be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit, in
the civil department, within this State." The friends of the
Judge nevertheless urged him to become a candidate for the
office. After a full and fair explanation of the latter and most
important objection, he became satisfied that it was not tenable;
and as to the former, that his duty to his country required
him to make the sacrifice. His name was accordingly brought
before the Legislature in the winter of 1833, and he was
elected by a large majority on the first ballot. At the ensuing
term of the Court he took his seat upon the bench, and
from that time until the very day of his death he continued
to discharge the duties of his office with an ability and devotion
seldom equaled and never surpassed. When a Convention
of the people of the State was called in 1835, to amend
the Constitution, he took a seat in it as one of the members
from the county of Craven. Of the manner in which he performed
the peculiarly delicate and important duties of assisting
to revise and amend our fundamental law, I know it is
needless for me to speak in this presence. The distinguished
President of this Institution, who was then Governor of the
State and a member of the Convention, can tell the extent
of his labors and the value of his services in that body.
Suffice it for me to say that he was placed on almost every
important committee; that he took a leading part in every
important debate; that he, in a great measure, guided and
directed the whole business of the Convention. And when
its labors were at last brought to a successful conclusion, it
was from his hand that the amendments to the Constitution
received the form and dress in which they now appear. Excepting
his judicial duties, this was the last public service in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
which he was engaged. It is true that when our Senators
in Congress resigned in 1840, the Whig party, which had
then the ascendency in the Legislature, tendered him the
nomination for one of the vacancies; but he declined it, preferring
to remain on the bench, where he thought he could
do the State better service. Nor need we regret his determination;
for though none could have represented the State in
the Senate with more dignity, fidelity, and ability, yet his profound
legal attainments, his extensive and varied information,
his severe and patient habits of thought, and a style of composition
at once dignified and elegant, so admirably fitted him
for the high tribunal on which he was placed that we could
not have wished to see him transferred to any other station,
however exalted. But it is needless for me to enlarge upon
his judicial fitness and ability. The Chief Justice of the
Court, the associate of his labors and his duties, himself one
of the ablest judges and most profound lawyers of his day,
has emphatically pronounced from the judgment-seat that he
was a "great judge." In confirmation of this sentence, if it
needed confirmation, I would refer to all his reported judicial
opinions; and particularly to the opinion of the Court as delivered
by him in the case of the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Will</i>, 1 Dev. and
Bat. Rep., 121; and his dissenting opinion in the <i>State</i> vs.
<i>Miller</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, 500; the latter of which has been pronounced
by a very competent judge one of the finest judicial arguments
to be found in this country.</p>

<p>I have said that Judge Gaston continued in the faithful
discharge of his official duties until the very day of his death.
This is literally true. On Tuesday, the 23d of January past,
not quite a fortnight ago, he took his seat in the Court as
usual, though he had felt for several days a sensation of chilliness
and a difficulty of breathing. He remained on the
bench until about two o'clock <small>P. M.</small>, giving strict attention to
a case then under discussion, when he was attacked with faintness
and other symptoms of violent sickness. He was taken
to his room and a physician called in, who very soon relieved
him. He revived, became cheerful and engaged in an interesting
conversation with some of his friends who had called to
see him. In the course of the evening he told several anecdotes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at which they laughed heartily. "He then related"
(says a published account) "the particulars of a convivial party
at Washington City, many years ago, and spoke of one who,
on that occasion, avowed himself a freethinker in religion.
'From that day,' said Judge Gaston, 'I always looked on that
man with distrust. I do not say that a freethinker may not
be an honorable man; that he may not, from high motives,
scorn to do a mean act; but I dare not trust him. A belief
in an All-ruling Divinity, who shapes our ends, whose eye is
upon us, and who will reward us according to our deeds, is
necessary. We must believe and feel that there is a God&mdash;All
wise and Almighty." As he was pronouncing the last
word, he rose to give it greater emphasis. The moment after
there was a sudden rush of blood to the brain, when he immediately
fell back and expired.</p>

<p>In reviewing the life of this eminent man, which has been
thus hastily and imperfectly sketched, we see that though left
an orphan in earliest infancy in a country where he had no
kindred, save a widowed mother and an infant sister, though
professing a religious faith almost proscribed, and attached to
a political party always in the minority, he yet rose to the
highest summit of professional distinction, acquired, during a
brief career in the Legislature of his State, a preponderating
influence in its councils, was among the foremost of the great
in the national assembly, was selected by almost general acclamation
to preside in the highest judicial tribunal known to
our law, and, more than all, won and maintained to the day
of his death, the confidence, the admiration, and the affection
of his countrymen. It is interesting, and it must be profitable
to all, particularly to you, young gentlemen, who are just
entering upon the career of life, to inquire what were the
qualities and what the talents which enabled their possessor,
under such circumstances, to achieve such great results. In
the very outset of his life, we discover one trait to which
much, if not all, of his success was owing&mdash;his love and veneration
for his mother.</p>

<p>An early attention to all his duties, and a desire to excel
in everything useful, was another distinctive trait in the character
of Judge Gaston. We discover this in the rapid progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
made in his studies and the distinction which he acquired at
college. I am aware that college honors are often decried,
at least by those who never obtained them, and that it has
been frequently said that they afford no presage of excellence
in after-life. I beg leave to dissent from that opinion.
Judge Gaston himself thought far otherwise. Long after he
had left the walls of his <i>alma mater</i>, when his mind was
enlarged by observation and corrected by experience, he expressed
himself in an address to the young men who then occupied
the seats now filled by you in the following glowing
words: "True it is that it sometimes, though very rarely, happens
that those who have been idle during their academical
course have by extraordinary exertions retrieved their early
neglect and in the end outstripped others who started in the
race far ahead. These are exceptions&mdash;they furnish cause to
humble arrogance, check presumption, banish despair and
encourage reformation. But as surely as a virtuous life usually
precedes a happy death so surely will it be found that within
the college precincts is laid the groundwork of that pre-eminence
afterwards acquired in the strife of men; and that
college distinctions are not only good testimony of the fidelity
with which college duties have been performed, but the best
presages and pledges of excellence on a more extended and
elevated field of action."</p>

<p>A faithful and fearless discharge of whatever he found to
do in the path of duty was another prominent trait in the
character of the Judge. He never asked what interest or
policy might dictate, but what truth and justice required;
and the latter he resolutely performed, "uncaring consequences."
I might mention many instances of his braving
popular prejudices, and incurring for a time popular odium,
in doing what an enlightened conscience told him he ought
to do. A memorable instance is presented in his appearing
as counsel for Lord Granville in the famous suits which he
instituted in this State after the Revolutionary war. A
course, which all would now acknowledge to be right, then
very sensibly affected his popularity for many years. He was
at that time a young man, and it required no little of the force
of conscious rectitude to enable him to stem the torrent of
prejudice which ran so strong against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Another eminent quality which illustrated the whole life
of Judge Gaston was the constant love of order and a devoted
and almost sacred regard for the Constitution and laws of his
country. In all his precepts, wheresoever and to whomsoever
uttered, in all his conduct, whether in public or in private,
he inculcated and enforced obedience to the law, observance
of order, and the support and maintenance of our fundamental
institutions in all their integrity. His views and opinions
upon this subject are expressed in an address which he delivered
at Princeton in September, 1835, before the "American
Whig" and "Cliosophic" Societies of the College of New
Jersey. It is difficult to find anywhere, within the same
compass, the duties of an American citizen, in relation to the
laws and institutions of his country, so clearly expressed and
so powerfully enforced. The address was much admired at
the time, and received on two occasions a compliment of which
any man might be justly proud. In a charge to the grand
jury of his Court, Chief Justice Cranch, of the District of
Columbia, read several pages from the address, accompanied
by remarks of the highest commendation. And shortly afterwards,
Governor Vance, of Ohio, on an occasion so solemn as
his inauguration, quoted largely from it, after speaking in the
most flattering terms of the author, as one of the most eminent
statesmen and profound jurists of our country.</p>

<p>If the qualities which we have considered excite our admiration
and command our respect, that to which I would now
call your attention is well calculated to inspire love and win
affection. I mean his kind regard for the young. To them
he was ever accessible, kind and communicative; always ready
to give advice, or to impart instruction. Among them it was
his delight to unbend, after the severity of his official labors,
and to engage in their innocent amusements. Often have I
seen him in such moments of relaxation; and as I saw, I could
but admire and love a wisdom which, while it could instruct
senates, disdained not the sports of the young, nor even the
frolics of infancy; which, while it could one moment expound
the gravest of laws, could the moment after explain an apothegm
for the instruction of youth, or solve a riddle for the
amusement of childhood. His regard for the young extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from the earliest to the latest period of that time of life. For
those just approaching the verge of manhood he has often
given signal proofs of his solicitude. In 1832 he was invited
to deliver an address before the two Literary Societies of this
institution, and in 1835 he received an invitation to perform
a similar duty before the Societies of Princeton College in
New Jersey. In both instances, though at much personal inconvenience,
he complied with the request, and delivered the
addresses to which I have had occasion to allude. On the
merit of these productions the public has already decided. It
remains only for me to say that no young man can read them,
as they ought to be read, with care and attention, without
profit and advantage; and the best return I can make for your
kindness to me on this occasion is to advise each of you to
procure copies of them, and to "attend to their admonitions,
treasure up their counsels and obey their injunctions."</p>

<p>From what I have already said, you have doubtless anticipated
my account of the character of Judge Gaston in private
and domestic life. A kind master, a fond father, a true friend,
a most amusing and instructive companion, he made the social
intercourse of life a source at once of pleasure and profit.
None could make the grave remark, none could tell the laughable
anecdote, better than he. An evening spent among his
friends always left them in doubt whether to admire most the
extent of his information, the depth of his erudition, the variety
of his powers, or the easy, cheerful, instructive flow of
his conversation.</p>

<p>It can hardly be necessary for me to say that Judge Gaston
was always a zealous and enlightened friend to the cause of
education. His great services to the University as a guardian
and benefactor for more than forty years have been very
justly and appropriately acknowledged in the resolutions recently
adopted. He was appointed a trustee of the University
in the year 1802, and was at the time of his death, with the
exception of Judge Potter, the oldest member of the board.</p>

<p>The crowning glory of Judge Gaston's character remains
yet to be spoken of. He was a firm believer in the superintending
Providence of an All-wise and an Almighty Being, and
in the truths of Revelation. The principles of the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
religion were deeply impressed upon his infant mind by the
devoted piety of his excellent mother; and they were never
forgotten and never departed from. An abiding faith in
them was a staff to his hand and a lamp to his feet. It sustained,
guided, and animated him through life, and in the
hour of death it did not desert him. The last sentence he
uttered recognized its truth and its consolations. Yes, this
elegant scholar, this accomplished orator, this eminent statesman,
this profound jurist, was an humble follower of the
meek and lowly Jesus. He thought it no scorn to bow at the
footstool&mdash;he felt it no degradation to take upon him the yoke
of a Saviour. And when his last hour came, we cannot
doubt that the parting soul counted all&mdash;fame, reputation,
worldly pleasures, worldly honors&mdash;as but dross, in comparison
with that faith, upon whose wings it was upborne to the bright
realms of glory.</p>

<p>Such, my young friends, was the great and good man whose
life and character I have attempted to portray. I cannot
take upon myself to say that he was faultless: since the
memorable declaration of the incarnate Son of God, that
"there is none good save one, that is God," it would be impious
for me to do so; but whatever might have been his
frailties, he had such great virtues, such noble qualities, there
was such a harmony in his character, such a beauty in his
life, that I can conscientiously propose him for your study,
and recommend him for your imitation. Go then, and like
him, perform fully, faithfully, fearlessly, your duty to yourselves,
your families, your country and your God; and then,
like him, you will be honored in your lives, and when you
come to die, a nation's tears will hallow your graves.</p>

<h3><a name="ADDRESS_AT_THE_UNIVERSITY" id="ADDRESS_AT_THE_UNIVERSITY">ADDRESS AT THE UNIVERSITY.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM GASTON.</p>


<p><i>Gentlemen of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies</i>:</p>

<p>When I look around on this extraordinary concourse of visitors
I cannot but feel that expectation has been too highly
excited, and cannot but anticipate and regret the disappointment
which it must necessarily meet with. Aware of the
value which is here set upon the ceremony of the annual
address; knowing that friends of the University throughout
the State regard it as calculated not only to excite a spirit
of emulation among the students, but to attract the public
attention to the institution itself; and warmly attached to that
noble cause, for the advancement of which these edifices have
been erected and your associations formed, I felt myself bound
to accept the invitation, in obedience to which I appear before
you. Could I indeed have foreseen the unusual engagements
which, added to the ordinary occupations of a busy life, have
left me no leisure to prepare anything worthy of the general
expectation, I should have deemed myself at liberty to decline
the call. But the discovery was not made until after my word
was pledged and it was too late to hope that the duty could be
devolved on another. Compelled then to choose between an
entire disappointment of your hopes and the presenting myself
to you without the advantage of full preparation, I have resolved
to execute the undertaking imperfectly rather than
forego it altogether. To whatever petty mortifications the
adoption of this alternative may expose me elsewhere, from
you, my young friends, I am sure of a favorable reception.
You will see in it an expression of the sense which I entertain
of the honor conferred on me, by your choice, of my readiness
to gratify your wishes, and of my solicitude to cheer you on
in the noble career upon which you have entered. The few
homely truths which I wish to impress upon your minds will
not indeed come mended from my tongue, but I do not despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that, presented in their naked plainness, but urged with the
earnestness and sincerity of friendship, they may win their
way to your generous and affectionate approbation.</p>

<p>The authority of Shakespeare is often invoked for the position
that "there is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken
at the flood, leads on to fortune." Without venturing to
deny altogether the fitness of this metaphor, and fully admitting
it to have enough of truth to render it appropriate to the
occasion for which it was used, and the character to whom
the great poet assigned it, I yet regard it as too favorable to
that indolence of disposition which is always ready to imagine
success in life as depending on some fortunate tide. I hold
that, generally, every man is the architect of his own fortune,
the author of his own greatness or insignificance, happiness
or misery. True, it is, that casualties, neither to be foreseen
nor prevented, may defeat schemes which have been wisely
concerted and vigorously prosecuted; and that success, undeserved,
and perhaps unsought, may sometimes befall the
weak and slothful. These, however, are but occasional deviations
from the ordinary course of nature, according to which,
man's energies, wisely or foolishly directed, and diligently or
carelessly exerted, are made to determine his character and
condition in society. The stoutest ship that was ever manned
with prudent heads, brave hearts, and strong hands has foundered
in a hurricane, while the feeble bark that "owns no
mastery in floating" is sometimes safely wafted into port; yet,
who can deny that, ordinarily, the fate of the voyage must depend
on the skill, care, and courage with which it is conducted.
Much, too, very much, either for permanent good or ill in the
fate of every individual, has been found to follow almost necessarily
from the habits formed, the propensities cherished or
restrained, and the rules of conduct adopted at a very early
period of life. We might, perhaps, be tempted to regret that
such important and often awful consequences should follow
on the doings of an age, when the unworn senses are alive to
every impression and the keen appetite greedy for every enjoyment;
when the imagination is wild, the judgment feeble,
and "heedless, rambling impulse" has scarcely learned to
think. Yet such is the constitution of nature, and such consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the appointment of Him, whose ways are always wise,
benevolent and just, and whose will it were not more madness
to resist than it is impiety to question. Look through the
world, and the least observant cannot fail to discover talents
abused, opportunities squandered, and men ruined because of
early folly, misbehavior or thoughtlessness; and let those who
have passed through life's ordeal with safety and honor look
back on their trials, and they will acknowledge how much they
owe to very early impressions and to habits contracted almost
without a sense of their use or a foresight of their consequences.
He, therefore, who aspires to excellence cannot too soon propose
to himself the objects which he should strive to obtain,
nor fix his aim too early, or too steadily, on the end to which
his efforts should be directed. The shortness of life, large
fragments of which are necessarily occupied by animal wants
or wasted on frivolous cares and amusements, leave, at best,
but an inconsiderable portion to be devoted to intellectual
cultivation and exertion. To waste this portion would be
criminal improvidence, and it is of the highest moment to
learn betimes how it may be most beneficially applied.</p>

<p>The end which an ingenuous youth naturally proposes to
himself is a faithful and honorable discharge of the duties of
life. His objects are to realize the fond hopes of his parents
and friends, to acquire the affection and esteem of those
around him, to become the dispenser of good to his fellow-men
and thus to fulfill the purposes for which it has pleased God to
place him in this world of trial and discipline. He feels that
these objects are indeed good. By a moral instinct he is propelled
towards them as fit to fill his heart, kindle his aspirations,
and animate his exertions. Reason, as she gradually
unfolds her powers and assumes dominion over him, sanctions
this choice with her approbation; and religion comes in aid of
nature and reason, to teach him that talents are but lent to
be improved, and that an account must be one day rendered
in which their use or neglect will be amply rewarded or
severely punished. How much is it not to be lamented that
sloth should enervate, dissipation corrupt, or vice brutalize
this child of hope and promise? You, who have him in
charge, watch over him with never-sleeping vigilance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
affectionate solicitude. Give him a happy start, sustain him
when disposed to flag, reanimate him when discouraged, check
kindly his wanderings, soothe his wounded feelings, guide him
with your counsels, and save him from the foes by which he
is waylaid and beset. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macte nova virtute puer sic itur ad
astra.</i></p>

<p>Most faithfully, no doubt, are these duties performed by
the able and excellent men who are here charged with the
office of instruction. Little can be done in aid of their efforts
but to exhort and entreat all placed under their care to attend
to their admonitions, treasure up their counsels, and obey their
injunctions. Yet, there are some errors which were prevalent
when I was a boy which I have reason to believe still prevail
in public schools, and which may perhaps be better handled by
an old friend than an acknowledged instructor, and to these,
therefore, I would for a few moments request the favorable
attention of the younger portion of my hearers.</p>

<p>Vigorous, diligent, and persevering application is essential
to the attainment of excellence in every pursuit of man. It
is undoubtedly a mistake to suppose that there is no original
inequality in the mental faculties of different individuals.
Probably, there is as great a disparity in their intellectual as
in their physical conformation. But however false this extravagant
theory may be there is another error far more common,
and, practically, far more mischievous&mdash;the error of
exaggerating the difference between the original energies of
intellect, and of attributing to splendid and resistless genius
those victories which are not to be achieved but by well directed
and continued industry. It is in the infancy of life
that the inequalities of original talent are most striking, and
it is not strange that vanity, on the one hand, and indolent
admiration, on the other, should hyperbolically extol these
obvious advantages. In what this disparity consists it may
not be easy to state with precision. But from an observation
of many years, I venture to suggest that the chief natural
superiority manifested by the favored few over their competitors
in the intellectual conflict is to be found in the facility
with which their attention is directed and confined to its proper
subjects. That youth may be regarded as fortunate indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
who in early life can restrain his wandering thoughts and tie
down his mind at will to the contemplation of whatever he
wishes to comprehend and to make his own. A few moments
of this concentrated application is worth days and weeks of
a vague, interrupted, scattered attention. The first resembles
the well-known manœuvre in strategy, so simple in its conception
and yet so astonishing in its results, by which all the
arms of a military force are made to bear upon a given point
at the same moment. Everything here tells, because there is
no power wasted, and none misapplied. Now let no one
despair because he finds this effort to confine his attention
difficult, or for a considerable length of time, impracticable.
Nothing is more certain than that this power over the mind
may be acquired. Let the attempt be repeated again and
again&mdash;first short, afterwards (as the ability is increased) for
longer periods, and success will ultimately follow. The habit
of fixed attention will thus be created, and it is one of the
peculiarities of all active habits, that in proportion to the difficulty
with which they were produced, is their inveteracy, when
once thoroughly formed. Thus, it not unfrequently happens
that the advantages with which the individual commenced
his career, who was naturally alert and devoted in his attention
to every subject as it was successively presented to his
notice, have not enabled him to contend successfully with
him who, by hard efforts, has chained down his wandering
thoughts and dissipated faculties to the habit of attention.</p>

<p>Among the best results which attend a course of regular
academical education is this exclusive and concentrated direction
of the mental powers to their appropriate objects. In the
years employed principally in the study of the learned languages
the necessity of finding out the meaning of each word
and discerning either the agreement between different words
or the dependence of some of them upon others in certain
grammatical relations necessarily sharpens and fixes the attention.
After this preparatory discipline of the intellect the
student is introduced to the study of mathematical science,
where proposition leads on to proposition in regular order,
and his attention is necessarily enchained to each truth, as
it follows with logical certainty, from truths previously demonstrated.
He is then initiated into the mysterious laws of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
philosophy, as they have been discovered, explained and
illustrated, by a course of rigorous induction, and is ultimately
familiarized with the yet nobler and more sublime investigations
of moral science, the refinements of taste, the beauties
of eloquence, and the charm of heavenly poesy. And this
admirable training is conducted remote from the bustle and
cares of the world, in the very hush of the passions, and beyond
the reach of beguiling and distracting pleasures. Here
surely, then, the understanding is disciplined, its discrimination
rendered more acute, its general health and vigor confirmed,
while a facility is created for directing its powers to
the various manly and trying services which may await in
life's busy theatre. But not unfrequently is the question
asked by querulous students, why all this devoted attention to
the dead languages, to mathematical theorems, philosophical
experiments, metaphysical disquisitions and critical subtleties?
In the world [he soliloquizes] no one talks Greek or Latin,
and in the forum or legislative hall we shall not be called
upon to demonstrate the propositions of Euclid, or explain the
phenomena of hydrostatics and optics. The motives of human
action are better learned in that great practical school,
the world, than by poring over the theories of metaphysicians;
and all the rules of Quintilian, Rollin, or Blair will never
make a powerful reasoner or an eloquent orator. Why, then,
shall we consume our nights and days in the acquisition of
that which is to be of no practical utility hereafter, and which
brings with it no immediate advantage, except the gratification
of pride, a shortlived honor, a distinction at commencement?
Beware, my young friends, beware of the tempter!
These are the suggestions of sloth&mdash;the most insidious, persuasive
and dangerous of deceivers. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitanda est improba
Siren Desidia.</i></p>

<p>If you cannot close your ears against her insinuations,
strengthen your understandings to triumph over her sophisms,
and nerve your courage to resist her wiles. Be sure, if you
submit to her benumbing influence, and waste your days here
in idleness, the time will come, when with bitter, but perhaps
unavailing anguish, you shall bemoan your folly. Remember,
that it is not designed by an academical education to
teach you all that it behooves you to learn. Education is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
completed within these walls. When you shall have quitted
this peaceful retreat, and selected the profession or state in
life in which you are to be engaged, then you should apply all
your efforts to the acquisition of that species of knowledge
which is more especially needed. Here are inculcated those
elementary principles of science and literature which experience
has shown to be best fitted to form the foundation of the
character of the scholar and gentleman&mdash;those rudiments of
instruction, which, omitted here, are rarely indeed acquired
afterwards. Here are to be formed those habits of vigorous
and continuous application&mdash;here, the capacities for improvement
are to be cultivated and strengthened, so that every
occasion and every employment without these walls may become
subsidiary to further advancement in knowledge, ability,
and usefulness. It is a miserable fallacy to mistake the exception
for the rule. True it is, that those who have won the
highest honors at college do not always realize the hopes which
these glorious beginnings have excited. "The fair bloom of
fairest fruit" may be blasted by pestilent dews. Folly, vanity
and vice, low pursuits and vulgar associations, indolence, intemperance,
and debauchery but too often debase and destroy
the generous youth who entered on life's career rich in academical
distinction, docile, ardent for fame, patient of labor, of
manly purpose and noblest promise. Mourn over these moral
wrecks. Lament the inadequacy of all earthly good, the frail
character of all human excellence. Weep for those who have
fallen from their high estate, but say not it was folly in them
thus to have risen. True it is also, that it sometimes, though
very rarely, happens that those who have been idle during
their academical course have, by extraordinary exertions, retrieved
their early neglect, and in the end outstripped others
who started in the race far ahead. These are the exceptions&mdash;they
furnish cause to humble arrogance, check presumption,
banish despair, and encourage reformation. But so surely as
a virtuous life usually precedes a happy death, so surely it
will be found that within the college precincts is laid the
groundwork of that preeminence afterwards acquired in the
strife of men, and that college distinctions are not only good
testimony of the fidelity with which college duties have been
performed, but the best presages and pledges of excellence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a more elevated and extensive field of action. In defiance,
therefore, of all the lures of pleasure and seductive suggestions
of sloth, let active, persevering industry be the habit of your
lives. Form this habit here, and cherish and preserve it ever
afterwards.</p>

<p>But however earnestly you are thus exhorted to diligence,
let it not be forgotten that diligence itself is but a subordinate
quality, and derives its chief value from the end to which it
is directed and the motives by which it is impelled. It is
diligence in a good cause only that is commendable. The
first great maxim of human conduct, that which it is all-important
to impress on the understandings of young men, and
recommend to their hearty adoption is, above all things, in all
circumstances, and under every emergency, to preserve a clean
heart and an honest purpose. Integrity, firm, determined
integrity, is that quality which, of all others, raises man to
the highest dignity of his nature, and fits him to adorn and
bless the sphere in which he is appointed to move. Without
it, neither genius nor learning, neither the gifts of God,
nor human exertions, can avail aught for the accomplishment
of the great objects of human existence. Integrity
is the crowning virtue&mdash;integrity is the pervading principle
which ought to regulate, guide, control, and vivify
every impulse, desire, and action. Honesty is sometimes
spoken of as a vulgar virtue; and perhaps that honesty, which
barely refrains from outraging the positive rules ordained by
society for the protection of property, and which ordinarily
pays its debts and performs its engagements, however useful
and commendable a quality, is not to be numbered among
the highest efforts of human virtue. But that integrity which,
however tempting the opportunity, or however secure against
detection, no selfishness nor resentment, no lust of power,
place, favor, profit or pleasure can cause to swerve from the
strict rule of right, is the perfection of man's moral nature.
In this sense the poet was right when he pronounced an honest
man the noblest work of God. It is almost inconceivable
what an erect and independent spirit this high endowment
communicates to man, and what a moral intrepidity and
vivifying energy it imparts to his character. There is a
family alliance between all the virtues, and perfect integrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
is always followed by a train of goodly qualities, frankness,
benevolence, humanity, patriotism, promptness to act, and
patience to endure. In moments of public need, these indicate
the man who is worthy of universal confidence. Erected
on such a basis, and built up of such materials, fame is enduring.
Such is the fame of our Washington, of the man
"inflexible to ill and obstinately just." While, therefore,
other monuments, intended to perpetuate human greatness,
are daily mouldering into dust, and belie the proud inscriptions
which they bear, the solid granite pyramid of his glory
lasts from age to age, imperishable, seen afar off, looming
high over the vast desert, a mark, a sign, and a wonder for the
wayfarers through this pilgrimage of life.</p>

<p>A nice sense of integrity cannot, therefore, be too early
cherished, or too sedulously cultivated. In the very dawnings
of life occasions are presented for its exercise. Within
these walls temptations every day occur, when temporary advantage
solicits a deviation from the rule of right. In the
discharge of the various duties which you owe to your companions,
let no petty selfishness be indulged, no artifices practiced,
by which you are to escape from your fair share of
labor, inconvenience or contribution, or any one deprived of
the full measure of whatever he may rightfully claim. Cultivate
singleness of purpose and frankness of demeanor, and
hold in contempt whatever is sordid, disingenuous, cunning or
mean. But it is when these peaceful shades shall have been
left behind, and the fitful course of busy life begun, that
seductions will be presented under every form by which inexperience,
infirmity of purpose, and facility of disposition, can
be waylaid. Then is the crisis of the young man's fate&mdash;then
is the time to take his stand, to seize his vantage ground. If
he can then defy the allurements of cupidity, sensuality and
ambition, the laugh of fools, the arts of parasites, and the
contagion of improbity, then indeed, may he hope,</p>

<span class="i0">"In sight of mortal and immortal powers,<br /></span>

<p>You, my young friends, who are standing at the threshold,
and waiting with eager impatience the signal for entrance
upon life, must not think that I mean to alarm you with idle
fears because I thus warn you of the approaching conflict.
The enraged bull may close his eyes before he rushes upon his
foe, but rational courage calmly surveys danger, and then
deliberately prepares and determines to encounter it.
Apprised of your peril, and armed for the encounter, enter on
your course with resolved hearts, and fear not for the issue.</p>

<p>So sweet are the notes of human praise, and so abhorrent
the tones of reproach, that it is among the highest efforts of
magnanimity to pursue the straightforward course of duty,
without being turned aside by commendation or reproof, by
flattery or calumny. Whatever be our journey through life,
like the princess in the eastern tale, ascending the mountain
in search of the wondrous bird, we are sure to hear around
us the confused sounds of blandishment and solicitation, or
menace and insult, until with many of us, the giddy head
is turned, and we are converted into monuments of warning
to those who are to follow life's adventure. Rare, indeed, is
that moral courage which, like the prudent Parizade, closes
its ears against the impression of these sounds, and casts not
an eye behind until its destined course be accomplished.
Rare, however, as may be this excellence, and in its perfection
perhaps unattainable, there can be no true dignity and decision
of character without a near approach to it. Let youth
be ever modest, ever deferential to the counsels, the suggestions
and the claims of others. But in matters of right and
wrong, whatever be the lures, the taunts, or the usages of the
world, or whatever the supposed inconveniences of singularity,
let judgment and conscience always rule with absolute sway.
Carry this maxim with you through life, whatever be the
station you are to occupy, or the business you are to pursue;
and carry with it another kindred maxim&mdash;rely for success
in your undertakings, not on the patronage of others, but on
your own capacity, resolution, diligence, and exertions. Rise
by merit, or rise not at all. Suited as these injunctions are
believed to be by all, they are peculiarly addressed to those
who, panting for renown, are resolved to enter upon a public
career, and long "to read their history in a nation's eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"O how wretched," exclaimed the Poet of Nature, "is
that poor man that hangs on princes' favors." Miserable is
the condition of every being who hangs on the favors of
creatures like himself. Deserve, and strive by desert, to win
the esteem of your fellow-men. Thus acquired, it decorates
him who obtains and blesses those who bestow it. To them it
is returned in faithful service, and to him in aid of the approbation
of conscience to animate diligence and reward exertion.
Those too, who engage in public service, are bound to cherish
a hearty sympathy with the wants, feelings, comforts, and
wishes of the people&mdash;whose welfare is committed to their
charge. It is essential for the preservation of that confidence
which ought to subsist between the principal and the agent,
the constituent and the representative, that all haughtiness
and reserve should be banished from their intercourse. It
sometimes happens that he who has lived too constantly among
books manifests a disgust in an association with the uneducated
and unrefined, which mortifies and repels them. This
is absurd in him, and unjust to them. It is absurd, for he
ought to know, and know well, those for whom, and upon
whom, he expects to act&mdash;they constitute in fact, one of the
first and most appropriate objects of his study; and it is unjust,
for not unfrequently under this roughness which shocks the
man of books is to be found a stock of practical information,
in which he is miserably deficient. Banish, then, all superciliousness,
for it is criminal and ridiculous. Honestly seek
to serve your country, for it is glorious to advance the good
of your fellow-men, and thus, as far as feeble mortals may,
act up to the great example of Him in whose image and likeness
you are made. Seek also, by all honest arts, to win their
confidence, but beware how you prefer their favor to their
service. The high road of service is indeed laborious, exposed
to the rain and sun, the heat and dust; while the by-path
of favor has, apparently, at first, much the same direction,
and is bordered with flowers and sheltered by trees, "cooled
with fountains and murmuring with waterfalls." No wonder,
then, that like the son of Abensina, in Johnston's beautiful
apologue the young adventurer is tempted to try the happy
experiment of "uniting pleasure with business, and gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the rewards of diligence without suffering its fatigues."
But once entered upon, the path of favor, though found
to decline more and more from its first direction, is pursued
through all its deviations, till at length even the
thought of return to the road of service is utterly abandoned.
To court the fondness of the people is found or supposed to
be easier than to merit their approbation. Meanly ambitious
of public trust, without the virtues to deserve it; intent on
personal distinction, and having forgotten the ends for which
alone it is worth possessing, the miserable being, concentered
all in self, learns to pander to every vulgar prejudice, to advocate
every popular error, to chime in with every dominant
party, to fawn, flatter and deceive, and become a demagogue!
All manliness of principle has been lost in this long course
of meanness: he dare not use his temporary popularity for
any purposes of public good, in which there may be a hazard
of forfeiting it; and the very eminence to which he is exalted
renders but more conspicuous his servility and degradation.
However clear the convictions of his judgment, however strong
the admonitions of his, as yet, not thoroughly stifled conscience,
not these, not the law of God, nor the rule of right,
nor the public good, but the caprice of his constituents, must
be his only guide. Having risen by artifice, and conscious of
no worth to support him, he is in hourly dread of being supplanted
in the favor of the deluded multitude by some more
cunning deceiver. And such, sooner or later, is sure to be his
fate. At some unlucky moment, when he bears his blushing
honors thick upon him&mdash;and well may such honors blush&mdash;he
is jerked from his elevation by some more dextrous demagogue,
and falls, unpitied, never to rise again. Can this be
the lot of him who has been here trained to admire and love
high-minded excellence, and who has been taught by high
classical authority to regard with the same fearless and immovable
indifference the stern countenance of the tyrant and
the wicked ardor of the multitude, and who has learned from
a yet higher and holier authority to hold fast to "whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
things are just, whatsoever things are pure, to abhor that
which is evil and cleave to that which is good?" Believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
me, however, this is no fancy picture. The original may be
found in the world every day. Nor will it surprise those who
have had occasion to see how the vain heart is swollen, and
the giddy head turned, how honesty of purpose and manliness
of spirit are perverted by popular applause. It is but the
first step that costs. Once yield to the suggestion that a little
deceit or prevarication, a slight sacrifice of principle and independence,
a compromise of conscience in matters not absolutely
fundamental, may be excused, when the immediate gain is
obvious and the end in view important, and the downward
path becomes every day more and more smooth until, in its
descent, it reaches the very abyss of vulgar, trading, intriguing,
electioneering, office-hunting politicians. If in this
lowest depth a lower deep can be found, none of us, I am sure,
have the curiosity to explore it.</p>

<p>But is integrity sure to meet here its merited reward?
Unquestionably not. If it were, and the fact generally
known, there would scarcely be room for choice, and men
would be honest from the want of a plausible temptation
to be otherwise. But it is not too much to say, that in
general, integrity has a tendency to promote the interests of
him who pursues it, and it is therefore recommended to our
adoption by prudence, not less than by principle. Success
in the acquisition of any intrinsic object is necessarily uncertain,
since it depends on contingencies which cannot be
foreseen, and which, if foreseen, are frequently beyond our
power. It is not in mortals to command success. No talent,
no courage, no industry, and no address can be certain to
effect it. But when it is attempted by cunning, disingenuous
means, it is usually rendered more difficult of attainment
because of the complexity of the scheme and the risk of detection
and counteraction. Honesty, in the long run, is therefore
the surer policy. It is impossible to thrive without the
reputation of it, and it is far easier to be honest, indeed, than
to cheat the world into the belief of integrity where it is not.
The crooked stratagems, the arts, toils, concealments and self-denials,
which are necessary to carry on a successful imposition,
are far more onerous and painful than all the duties
which a life of probity enjoins; while the consciousness of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
upright deportment diffuses through the whole man that security
and serenity which infinitely outweighs all the advantages
of successful cunning. Nor, in recommending a spirit
of independence, is it intended to proscribe the acceptance of
friendly aid, freely tendered, and won by no mean solicitation.
Children of the same common family, we are bound to help
each other in the trials and difficulties of our common pilgrimage;
nor should we ever be too proud to receive from others
that assistance which it is our duty to render to them. Now
such aid is not only more likely to be bestowed, but comes
with far greater effect, when there has been a manly and sustained
effort to do without it. The spindling plant which
has always been supported by a prop is not only unable to
stand alone, but can scarcely be sustained by props when the
season of fruit arrives; whereas, the slight assistance then bestowed
on the hardy tree that, self-sustained, has always braved
the breeze, will enable it to bear up under the heaviest and
richest burthen. He who trusts to others must necessarily
be often disappointed, and the habit of dependence creates
a helplessness which is almost incapable of exertion. Fancy
dwells on expected aid, until it mistakes its own creations for
realities, and the child of illusion wastes life in miserable daydreams,
unable to act for himself, and confidently relying on
assistance which he is destined never to receive.</p>

<p>Deeply-rooted principles of probity, confirmed habits of industry,
and a determination to rely on one's own exertions
constitute, then, the great preparation for the discharge of
the duties of man, and the best security for performing them
with honor to one's self and benefit to others. But it may be
asked what is there in such a life of never-ending toil, effort
and privation, to recommend it to the acceptance of the young
and the gay? Those who aspire to heroic renown, may indeed
make up their minds to embrace these "hard doctrines;" but
it may be well questioned whether happiness is not preferable
to greatness, and enjoyment more desirable than distinction.
Let others, if they will, toil "up the steep where Fame's proud
temple shines afar"; we choose rather to sport in luxurious ease
and careless glee in the valley below. It is, indeed, on those
who aspire to eminence that these injunctions are intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
be pressed with the greatest emphasis, not only because a
failure in them would be more disastrous than in others, but
because they are exposed to greater and more numerous dangers
of error. But it is a sad mistake to suppose that they
are not suited to all, and are not earnestly urged upon all,
however humble their pretensions or moderate their views.
Happiness, as well as greatness, enjoyment as well as renown,
have no friends so sure as Integrity, Diligence, and Independence.
We are not placed here to waste our days in wanton
riot or inglorious ease, with appetites perpetually gratified
and never palled, exempted from all care and solicitude, with
life ever fresh, and joys ever new. He who has fitted us for
our condition, and assigned to us its appropriate duties, has
not left his work unfinished, and omitted to provide a penalty
for the neglect of our obligations. Labor is not more the
duty than the blessing of man. Without it there is neither
mental nor physical vigor, health, cheerfulness, nor animation;
neither the eagerness of hope, nor the capacity to enjoy.
Every human being must have some object to engage his attention,
excite his wishes, and rouse him to action, or he sinks,
a prey to listlessness. For want of proper occupation, see
strenuous idleness resorting to a thousand expedients&mdash;the
race-course, the bottle, or the gaming-table, the frivolities of
fashion, the debasements of sensuality, the petty contentions
of envy, the grovelling pursuits of avarice, and all the various
distracting agitations of vice. Call you these enjoyments?
Is such the happiness which it is so dreadful to forego?</p>

<p>If to every bounty of Providence there be annexed, as
assuredly there is, some obligations as a condition for its enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on us, blest as we have been, and as we now are, with
the choicest gifts of heaven here below&mdash;with freedom, peace,
order, civilization and social virtue&mdash;there are unquestionably
imposed weighty obligations. You whom I now address will,
in a few years, be among the men of the succeeding age. In
a country like ours, where the public will is wholly unfettered,
and every man is a component part of that country,
there is no individual so humble who has not duties of a public
kind to discharge. His views and actions have an influence
on those of others, and his opinions, with theirs, serve to make
up that public will. More especially is this the case with
those who, whatever may be their pursuits in life, have been
raised by education to a comparative superiority in intellectual
vigor and attainments. On you, and such as you, depends the
fate of the most precious heritage ever won by the valor, preserved
by the prudence, or consecrated by the virtue of an
illustrious ancestry&mdash;illustrious, not because of factitious titles,
but nature's nobles, wise, good, generous, and brave! To you,
and such as you, will be confided in deposit the institutions
of our renowned and beloved country. Receive them with
awe, cherish them with loyalty, and transmit them whole,
and, if possible, improved, to your children. Yours will, indeed,
be no sinecure office. As the public will is the operative
spring of all public action, it will be your duty to make and
to keep the public will enlightened. There will always be
some error to dispel, some prejudice to correct, some illusion
to guard against, some imposition to detect and expose. In
aid of these individual efforts, you must provide, by public
institutions, for diffusing among the people that general information,
without which, they cannot be protected from the
machinations of deceivers. As your country grows in years,
you must also cause it to grow in science, literature, arts, and
refinement. It will be for you to develop and multiply its
resources, to check the faults of manners as they rise, and to
advance the cause of industry, temperance, moderation, justice,
morals, and religion all around you. On you too, will
devolve the duty which has been long neglected, but which
cannot with impunity be neglected much longer, of providing
for the mitigation, and (is it too much to hope for in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Carolina?) for the ultimate extirpation of the worst evil that
afflicts the southern part of our confederacy. Full well do
you know to what I refer, for on this subject there is, with all
of us, a morbid sensitiveness which gives warning even of an
approach to it. Disguise the truth as we may, and throw the
blame where we will, it is slavery which, more than any other
cause, keeps us back in the career of improvement. It stifles
industry and represses enterprise&mdash;it is fatal to economy and
providence, it discourages skill, impairs our strength as a community,
and poisons morals at the fountain-head. How this
evil is to be encountered, how subdued, is indeed a difficult
and delicate inquiry which this is not the time to examine nor
the occasion to discuss. I felt, however, that I could not discharge
my duty without referring to this subject, as one which
ought to engage the prudence, moderation, and firmness of
those who, sooner or later, must act decisively upon it.</p>

<p>I would not depress your buoyant spirits with gloomy
anticipations, but I should be wanting in frankness if I did not
state my convictions that you will be called to the performance
of other duties unusually grave and important. Perils
surround you, and are imminent, which will require clear
heads, pure intentions and stout hearts to discern and overcome.
There is no side on which danger may not make its
approach, but from the wickedness and madness of factions
it is most menacing. Time was, indeed, when factions contended
amongst us with virulence and fury, but they were,
or affected to be, at issue on questions of principle; now
Americans band together under the names of men, and wear
the livery and put on the badges of their leaders; then the
individuals of the different parties were found side by side,
dispersed throughout the various districts of our confederated
republic, but now the parties that distract the land are almost
identified with our geographical distinctions. Now, then, has
come the period foreseen and dreaded by our Washington&mdash;by
him, "who more than any other individual, founded this,
our wide-spreading empire, and gave to our western world
independence and freedom"&mdash;by him, who with a father's
warning voice, bade us beware of "parties founded on geographical
discriminations." As yet, the sentiment so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
planted in the hearts of our honest yeomanry, that union is
strength, has not been uprooted. As yet, they acknowledge
the truth and feel the force of the homely but excellent
aphorism, "United we stand, divided we fall." As yet, they
take pride in the name of "the United States"&mdash;in the recollection
of the fields that were won, the blood which was
poured forth, and the glory which was gained in the common
cause, and under the common banner of a united country.
May God, in His mercy, forbid that I or you, my friends,
should live to see the day when these sentiments and feelings
shall be extinct! Whenever that day comes, then is the
hour at hand when this glorious republic, this once national
and confederated Union, which for nearly half a century has
presented to the eyes, the hopes and the gratitude of man
a more brilliant and lovely image than Plato or More or
Harrington ever feigned or fancied, shall be like a tale that
is told, like a vision that hath passed away. But these sentiments
and feelings are necessarily weakened, and in the end
must be destroyed, unless the moderate, the good, and the wise
unite to "frown indignantly upon the first dawnings of every
attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest,
or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together its
various parts." Threats of resistance, secession, separation
have become common as household words in the wicked and
silly violence of public declaimers. The public ear is familiarized
with and the public mind will soon be accustomed to
the detestable suggestion of <em>disunion</em>! Calculations and
conjectures, what may the East do without the South, and
what may the South do without the East, sneers, menaces,
reproaches, and recriminations, all tend to the same fatal end!
What can the East do without the South? What can the
South do without the East? They may do much; they may
exhibit to the curiosity of political anatomists, and the pity
and wonder of the world the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</i>, the sundered,
bleeding limbs of a once gigantic body instinct with life and
strength and vigor. They can furnish to the philosophic historian
another melancholy and striking instance of the political
axiom that all republican confederacies have an inherent and
unavoidable tendency to dissolution. They will present fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and occasion for border wars, for leagues and counter-leagues,
for the intrigues of petty statesmen, the struggles of military
chiefs, for confiscations, insurrections, and deeds of darkest
hue. They will gladden the hearts of those who have proclaimed
that men are not fit to govern themselves, and shed
a disastrous eclipse on the hopes of rational freedom throughout
the world. Solon in his code proposed no rational punishment
for parricide, treating it as an impossible crime. Such
with us ought to be the crime of political parricide&mdash;the dismemberment
of our "fatherland." <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cari sunt parentes, cari
liberi, propinqui, familiares; sed omnes omnium caritates
patria una complexa est; pro qua quis bonus dubitet mortem
oppetere, si ei sit profuturus? Quo est detestabilior istorum
immanitas qui lacerarunt omni scelere patriam, et in ea
funditus delenda occupati et sunt et fuerunt.</i></p>

<p>If it must be so, let parties and party men continue to quarrel
with little or no regard to the public good. They may mystify
themselves and others with disputations on political economy,
proving the most opposite doctrines to their own satisfaction,
and perhaps to the conviction of no one else on earth. They
may deserve reprobation for their selfishness, their violence,
their errors, or their wickedness. They may do our country
much harm. They may retard its growth, destroy its harmony,
impair its character, render its institutions unstable,
pervert the public mind, and deprave the public morals.
These are indeed evils, and sore evils, but the principle of life
remains, and will yet struggle with assured success over these
temporary maladies. Still we are great, glorious, united, and
free, still we have a name that is revered abroad and loved at
home&mdash;a name which is a tower of strength to us against foreign
wrong and a bond of internal union and harmony, a name
which no enemy pronounces but with respect, and which no
citizen hears but with a throb of exultation. Still we have that
blessed Constitution which, with all its pretended defects and
all its alleged violations, has conferred more benefit on man
than ever yet flowed from any other human institution&mdash;which
has established justice, insured domestic tranquillity,
provided for the common defense, promoted the general welfare,
and which, under God, if we be true to ourselves, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
insure the blessings of liberty to us and to our posterity.
Surely such a country and such a Constitution have claims
upon you, my friends, which cannot be disregarded. I entreat
and adjure you, then, by all that is near and dear to you on
earth, by all the obligations of patriotism, by the memory of
your fathers who fell in the great and glorious struggle, for
the sake of your sons whom you would not have to blush for
your degeneracy, by all your proud recollections of the past
and all your fond anticipations of the future renown of our
nation, preserve that country, uphold that Constitution. Resolve
that they shall not be lost while in your keeping, and
may God Almighty strengthen you to fulfill that vow!</p>

<small>BY WM. A. GRAHAM</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Badger commenced in the latter
part of the summer of 1825. He had already completed his
service as a judge, which office he resigned at the close of the
spring circuit of that year; had contested the palm of forensic
eloquence and professional learning with Seawell and Gaston,
with a wide increase of reputation, at the recent term of the
Supreme Court, and was returned to the practice in Orange,
where he had once resided, in generous competition with
Murphy, Nash, Yancey, Mangum, Hawks, Haywood, and
others&mdash;Mr. Ruffin, hitherto the leader at this bar, having
been appointed his successor on the bench of the Superior
Court.</p>

<p>He was then a little turned of thirty years of age. One
half of his time since his majority had been passed upon the
bench, yet his fame as a lawyer was fully established; and
though he doubtless afterwards added vastly to his stores of
erudition, yet in quickness of perception, readiness of comprehension,
clear and forcible reasoning, elegant and imposing
diction, in all that constitutes an orator and advocate, he had
attained an eminence hardly surpassed at any period of his
life. From that time and before it, I know not how long, till
the day he was stricken by the disease which terminated his
life, in North Carolina, at least, his name was on every tongue.
He was not only marked and distinguished, but an eminent
man. So bright and shining a character could not but attract
general observation; and though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hard is his fate on whom the public gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fixed forever, to detract or praise";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and while, with gay and hilarious nature, frank but somewhat
eccentrical manners and unequaled powers of conversation,
united with some infirmity of temper, his expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and conduct in the earlier half of his life were often the subject
of severe criticism; yet in the long period of from forty
to fifty years, in which he moved "in the high places of the
world," no one denied him the gifts of most extraordinary
talents and unswerving integrity and truthfulness. Even in
the particular in which complaint had been made&mdash;an imputed
hauteur and exclusiveness&mdash;his disposition was either
mellowed by time, or, what is more probable, his character
came to be better appreciated from being better understood;
and for years before the sad eclipse which obscured his usefulness
no man enjoyed more of the general confidence and favor
of the people, as none had possessed in a higher degree their
admiration.</p>

<p>Transferred to the more extended field of jurisprudence
administered in the courts of the United States, and afterwards
to the Senate of the nation, he took rank with the first
advocates, jurisprudents, and debaters of the Union; and the
purity of his morals, the elevation of his character, his readiness
and accomplishments as a conversationalist, the gayety
and vivacity of his manners, rendered him a general favorite
with old and young, the grave and gay, in the brilliant society
of the metropolis.</p>

<p>George Edmund Badger was born in New Bern, North
Carolina, on the 17th of April, 1795. His father, Thomas
Badger, Esq., the son of Edmund and Lucretia Badger, was
a native of Connecticut, and his birth is recorded to have taken
place at Windham, in that State, on the 27th of June, 1766.
Having received a good education, he came early in manhood
to New Bern, and thence to Spring Hill, in the county of
Lenoir, where for some time he taught school, but was then
probably a student of the law, and was in due time admitted
to the practice in this State. Fixing his residence in New
Bern, he early rose to distinction as a practitioner, and appears
in the published reports as one of the leading counsellors in
the courts of that riding, and in the Supreme Court of the
State, from 1792 till his death, which occurred from yellow
fever, while in attendance on a court at Washington, in Beaufort
county, on the 10th of October, 1799.</p>

<p>The traditions of the profession and of intelligent persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of his acquaintance represent him as a man of determined character
and great intellectual and professional ability, and leave
the question in doubt whether at the same period of life he
was more than equaled by his son. The late Peter Browne,
himself one of the first lawyers and men of letters of his time
in North Carolina, a contemporary at the bar of the senior
Badger, spoke of him, before the entrance of his son into
public life, as one of the ablest men he had ever known, and
especially as possessing a power to fascinate and control masses
of men in the most remarkable degree&mdash;a power, he added,
which the son might exert with similar effect, if he would.</p>

<p>His mother, by name Lydia Cogdell, was the daughter of
Colonel Richard Cogdell, of New Bern, a gentleman of much
consideration under the provincial rule in North Carolina, and
an active and bold leader in the movement of the Revolution.
As early as August, 1775, his name appears second on the list
of the committee of safety for New Bern district, appointed
by the first Congress of the province (that of Alexander Gaston
being at the head). Lydia Cogdell was a person of singular
vigor of mind and character, well fitted to encounter the
cares and trials of her early widowhood. Her husband had
experienced that which has been said to be the common lot
of the profession in this country, "to work hard, live well and
die poor," and left her with but little fortune to rear three
children, of whom George was the eldest and the only son.</p>

<p>According to her narrative, he manifested no fondness for
books, and made little progress in learning till about seven
years of age. At that period she placed in his hands Goldsmith's
<cite>Animated Nature</cite>. He was delighted with its perusal,
and she never found it necessary to stimulate his thirst for
knowledge afterwards. His preparatory course was taken in his
native town of New Bern, and at the age of fifteen he entered
Yale College. There he passed through the studies of the
freshman and the sophomore classes, when his education, so
far as it depended on schools, was brought to a close. A relative,
a man of fortune, at the North, who had hitherto furnished
the means for his college expenses (his own patrimony
being wholly insufficient), and from whose bounty he had
hoped to pass on to graduation, suddenly withdrew his support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and left him to his own exertions. Of the motives of
this unexpected arrest in his college career, on which so much
might have depended, it is useless, now at least, to speculate
or inquire. But it will be a source of gratification to his
friends to be assured that it was attributable to no demerit in
our student. True, his contemporaries at Yale differ widely
in their estimation of his capacities while there. The Northern
students, who belonged to a different society, regarded him
as a frolicsome youth, averse to mathematics, and fond of novel-reading,
who gave no indications of superior endowments.
On the other hand, a college classmate (Thomas P. Devereux,
Esq., of Halifax) and member of the same society, who knew
him intimately throughout life, and was five and twenty years
associated with him at the bar, affirms that "he was beyond
dispute the first boy of his class, composed of seventy individuals,
many of them afterwards distinguished men." He was
not, says this friend, "a hard student of the prescribed course.
Perhaps I ought to add that he was remiss in his college duties,
but he was eager for information to a most wonderful degree,
and among his fellow-students he exhibited the same intellectual
superiority we have seen him so steadily maintain
among men." To the same source I am indebted for the following
observations concerning his elocution, which I repeat
for the advantage and encouragement of the young. "I
think," he remarks, "that the thousands who listened to the
fluency with which Mr. Badger spoke, the clearness of his
enunciation, the exact accuracy of his sentences and the carefulness
of their formation&mdash;the right words always in the
right places&mdash;will be surprised to learn that in his youthful
attempts in debate he was almost a stammerer. I have heard
him say he owed exemption from downright stuttering to
his father, whom he remembered with affection, though under
five years of age at the time of his decease, who would not
permit him to speak while he hesitated in the least, but required
him to stand by his side perfectly silent, until he had
collected himself and arranged his thoughts. He, himself,
often asserted that any one could speak fluently who thought
clearly and did not lose his presence of mind."</p>

<p>He made known to President Dwight the reception of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
letter announcing the withdrawal of the patronage by which
he had been thus far supported, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res angusta domi</i>
which caused him to bid adieu to Yale when reaching the
portion of her curriculum by which his expanding mind would
have been most profited, and left with the regrets and kind
wishes of that venerable divine and instructor. In after years
when he had established a character, his <i>alma mater</i> honored
herself by volunteering a degree to her barely risen junior,
and enrolling his name among her sons with whom he should
have graduated in 1813, as, at a later period, she acknowledged
his still higher advancement in liberal learning, by conferring
upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws.</p>

<p>He appears to have indulged in no unavailing grief at the
freak of fortune which blasted his hopes of a collegiate education,
but returning home, though but little over seventeen
years of age, betook himself at once to the study of the law.
His legal preceptor was his maternal cousin, Hon. John
Stanly, of New Bern, who as an advocate, a statesman, a parliamentarian,
a wit and adept in conversation, is one of the historical
characters of North Carolina; and, who, viewing him
as I did, from the gallery of the House of Commons in my
boyhood, impressed me as an orator of more graceful and
elegant manner and action, according to my conception of the
Ciceronian standard, than any public speaker it has ever been
my fortune to hear.</p>

<p>Mr. Badger was granted a license to practice law in the
County Courts in the summer of 1814, and, according to the
usual probation, in the Superior Courts in 1815; the Judges
of the Supreme Court consenting to relax the ordinary rule
and overlook his nonage, by reason of the narrowness of his
fortune and the dependence of his mother and sisters upon
his exertions for their support. The war with England raging
in the former year, and an invasion of the State being threatened
by the British forces under Admiral Cockburn, then
hovering on our coasts, Governor Hawkins called out the
militia, and himself took the field, in an expedition for the
defense of New Bern and Beaufort. In this expedition Mr.
Badger served as aid-de-camp to General Calvin Jones, of
Wake, with rank of major; but the alarm soon ceasing, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the retirement of the enemy the soldier was again resolved into
the youthful barrister. A vacancy occurring in the office of
solicitor to prosecute the pleas of the State in that riding,
about this time, he was introduced to public notice by the temporary
appointment from the judge, and made one circuit in
that capacity.</p>

<p>In 1816, the year of his majority, he was returned a member
of the House of Commons from the town of New Bern;
and whatever advantages he may have lost by his retirement
from college (and they were doubtless many and important),
it may well be questioned whether any of the more fortunate
youths he had left behind in the classic shades of Yale were,
by this time, better fitted to play a distinguished part in a
deliberative assembly or a court of justice. Profiting by the
instruction, the conversation, the intercourse, and the example
of that accomplished gentleman, Mr. Stanly, and his
compeers, Gaston, Edward Graham, Moses Mordecai, and
others, whom he met at the bar or in society, but above all
by his own profound study, he not only gained great attainments
in the law, but (what is now I fear becoming rare), a
familiar acquaintance with the classic authors of English literature,
and with the arts of rhetoric and composition. He
wrote and spoke our language with a readiness, force, precision,
and propriety, the more remarkable because equally as
conspicuous in jocose and trifling conversation (in which he
freely indulged) as in public address. As a critic, whether
under the inspiration of a "good or bad natured muse," he
has had few peers among the judges of "English undefiled."
His appearance in the Legislature was the advent of a new
star above the horizon, somewhat erratic and peculiar in its
orbit, but effulgent even in its irregularities, and shining with
a splendor not unworthy of the oldest and greatest lights of
the firmament.</p>

<p>Tradition furnishes anecdotes of many encounters, during
the session, of gladiatorial skill, in which his love of pleasantry
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaudia certaminis</i> involved him with the late
Attorney-General Drew, a son of genius and of Erin, and
others, with various success: but it assures us that this, his first
and last session in the General Assembly, closed with a profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
impression and universal acknowledgment of his genius,
culture, and high promise for the future.</p>

<p>The Hon. Thomas Ruffin, the speaker of the House of Commons,
who had been first appointed a judge of the Superior
Court during this session, discovering in Mr. Badger a congenial
spirit, alike emulous with himself of liberal culture and
professional distinction, invited him to take his briefs and
pursue the practice in Orange. The acceptance of this proposition
carried him to Hillsborough as his place of residence
for the next two or three years, during which, having married
the daughter of Hon. James Turner, of Warren, he transferred
his home to Warrenton; thence he moved to Louisburg,
where he continued to reside until his retirement from
the bench in 1825, when he removed to Raleigh, and there
abode during the residue of his life.</p>

<p>How well he maintained his professional character in the
new field of his practice is observed in the fact that, with
but little of what is known as personal popularity, he was
elected a judge of the Superior Court by the Legislature in
its session of 1820, at the age of twenty-five. In this office
he rode the circuits four years with admitted ability, candor
and impartiality, evading no question and no duty; but he
was sometimes thought to err from quickness of temper and
too great readiness to assume responsibility. His courtesy
to the profession won him general esteem. The people,
though sometimes murmuring at the severity of a sentence
or a supposed arbitrary or whimsical order, regarded with
equal wonder the promptness and force with which he discussed
questions of law with the veterans of the bar, and the
intelligent, amusing and instructive conversation with which
he habitually entertained his acquaintances and associates.</p>

<p>I mention a single case in his administration of the law as
illustrative both of the firm and impartial hand with which
he dealt out justice and the jealous care with which the judiciary
of North Carolina has ever protected and maintained the
rights of the weak against the strong and influential. A
citizen of great fortune, and advanced age, who had represented
his county in earlier years in both Houses of the Legislature,
having also numerous and influential connections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
charged a free-negro with larceny of his property, had him
brought by warrant before a justice of the peace, prevailed
on the justice to try and convict him of the offense charged,
and to sentence him to punishment by stripes, which were
inflicted&mdash;a proceeding allowable by law, provided the
offender had been a slave. But here the culprit was a freeman,
and by the Constitution entitled to public trial in open
court before a jury of the country. The prosecutor, with
the justice and constable, was arraigned before the Superior
Court for this violation of law, and their guilt being established,
Judge Badger, who happened to preside at this term,
was strongly inclined to imprison the principal defendant, and
was only deterred by reason of his (said defendant's) age and
state of health; but, announcing that this was omitted from
that cause only, sentenced him to a fine of twelve hundred
dollars, the justice of the peace to fifty, and the constable to
ten dollars, the differences being made on account of their
several grades of intelligence and consequent criminality, as
well as of ability to pay.</p>

<p>From the time of his return to the bar and location at
Raleigh, until the access of disease which suddenly, and, as
it proved, finally arrested his course, he devoted his time to
the practice of his profession, with the exception of a few
months, occasioned by his appointment by Harrison and his
continuation by Tyler as Secretary of the Navy, and such
further interruption as was produced by his occupation of a
seat in the Senate of the United States from 1846 to 1855.
During his forensic career he was, at different times, proposed
by executive nomination for the bench of the Supreme Court,
both of his own State and of the United States; but the spirit
of party exacted a denial of his confirmation, though no man
doubted his eminent qualification.</p>

<p>If it be true, as remarked by Pinkney, in one of his familiar
letters, published by Wheaton, that "the bar is not a place to
acquire or preserve a false or a fraudulent reputation for
talents," it was eminently so in his case. He had an intrepid
and self-reliant mind, which, disdaining artifice, timidity or
caution, struck out into the open field of controversy with the
daring of conscious power, and shunned no adversary not clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in the panoply of truth; was as ready to challenge the
authority of Mansfield or Denman, Rosyln or Eldon, if found
deflecting from the paths of principle or precedent, as that of
meaner names. If, from want of opportunity or inclination,
he had failed to master the mathematics of numbers, he made
himself proficient in the mathematics of life (as our law, from
the exactness of rule at which it aims, has been not inaptly
denominated), and by a rigorous logic was prompt to expose
whatever could not bear the test of reason. Yet, it was a
logic free from the pedantry of the schools, apparently not
derived from books, and accompanied by a rapidity of mental
action, which gave to it the appearance of intuition. Whether
in analysis or synthetical reasoning, in dealing with facts
before juries or the most intricate questions of law before
courts, these faculties were equally conspicuous, and attended,
when occasion called for their use, with powers of humor,
sarcasm, and ridicule hardly inferior to those of ratiocination.
Added to all this, there was a lucidness of arrangement, an
exact grammatical accuracy in every sentence, a forcible and
graceful style which, independent of a clear and distinct enunciation,
a melodious voice and engaging manner, imparted
even to his extemporaneous arguments the charms of polished
composition.</p>

<p>On one occasion, in a case of indictment for blasphemy, the
question had been raised whether the Christian religion was
a part of the common law, with a suggestion that if it was, it
might be altered by statute, Mr. Badger volunteered an argument
for the cause of religion and sound morality. It so
happened that, as he opened his case, a venerable citizen of
the State, of great intelligence, entered the court-room to
speak a word to the reporter, expecting immediately to retire.
He was, however, so fascinated with the manner of the
speaker, the splendor of his diction, the copiousness of his theological
and legal learning, the force and clearness of his arguments
and the precision with which they were stated, that he
sat down and heard him to the close, observing, as he withdrew,
"what folly ever to have made him a judge, he ought
to have been a bishop."</p>

<p>Literature, whose office it is to preserve the results of learning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
knowledge, and fancy, has made so little progress among
us that there has not been much effort to save from oblivion
the discussions at the bar or in the deliberative assemblies of
the State&mdash;the chief theatres of public intellectual exertion
besides the pulpit. Had Mr. Badger been studious of posthumous
fame and bestowed half the time in reporting his
speeches in the more important of his causes on the circuit,
which Cicero recommended and practiced in the preparation
of his orations, the result would have been a most interesting
contribution to American rhetorical literature. There are
occasions enough within the recollection of many, who were
present, in Wake, Orange, Granville, Halifax, and elsewhere,
when his utterances, even if printed as delivered, would have
formed a volume of no less interest than the speeches of Wirt
or Emmet, Erskine or Curran, as well as afforded insight into
events, crimes, transactions of business, and the state of society
of our times, such as the muse of history derives from the
records of courts of justice.</p>

<p>Two causes in the Circuit Court of the United States, in
the days of Chief Justice Marshall, are especially remembered
as being the themes of his most admired arguments, and in
which he overcame the preconceived opinions of the great
Judge, though impressed and supported by the acknowledged
abilities, learning and persuasiveness of Gaston. These were
the cases of <i>Whitaker</i> vs. <i>Freeman</i>, an action for libel in
twenty-five different counts, and <i>Lattimer</i> vs. <i>Poteat</i>, one of
a series of cases in ejectment, to recover immense bodies of
land in the western counties, claimed by the citizens of Northern
States under purchases from speculators who, it was
alleged, had made their entries and procured grants before
the extinction of the title of the Cherokee Indians, in violation
of law; the defendants claiming under grants from the
State made after the admitted cession of the Indian title; and
Mr. Badger was retained by the State to defend their interests.
This latter case, involving the relations of North Carolina
while a separate sovereignty, and afterwards of the United
States with the Cherokee Indians, as regulated by sundry
treaties, the location of several lines of partition between them
and the whites, but removed further and further west as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the population of the superior race increased and emigration
advanced, surveys partially or wholly made to establish
these lines through a mountainous, and in many parts, an impervious
country, imputed frauds in transgressing those lines
and entries without actual survey, was of exceeding volume
and complication in its facts, and occupied a week in the trial.
The argument, running through four days, was said to be the
most elaborate on both sides ever made in the State in a jury
trial. It resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendants,
which was afterwards affirmed by the Supreme Court
of the United States. After the trial, Judge Marshall, in the
simplicity and candor of his great character, observed to the
then Governor of the State, "At the close of Mr. Gaston's
opening argument, I thought he had as good a case as I ever
saw put to a jury, but Mr. Badger had not spoken two hours
before he satisfied me that no one of his [Gaston's] positions
could be maintained."</p>

<p>To this instance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudatus a laudato viro</i> I deem it not
improper to add a few others from sources only less eminent:
Chief Justice Henderson declared in my presence that "To
take up a string of cases, run through them, extract the principle
contained in each, and discriminate the points in which
they differed from each other, or from the case in hand, I
have never seen a man equal to George Badger."</p>

<p>Judge Seawell remarked of him: "Badger is an elementary
man," and, continuing in his peculiar and racy style, "he
goes to first principles; he finds the corners of his survey and
then runs out the boundaries, while others hunt along the
lines. The difference between him and myself is, that when
I take up a book I read slowly, pausing at the end of each
sentence, and when I have reached the bottom of the page I
must stop and go back to see whether I fully comprehend the
author's meaning, while he reads it off like a novel, and by the
time he gets to the bottom of the page or the end of the
treatise he has in his mind not only all that the author has
taught, but a great deal that the author never knew."</p>

<p>Chief Justice Ruffin, yet surviving in honorable retirement
from the labors of the profession, whose early appreciation of
the faculties of Mr. Badger we have already noticed, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
whom as a Judge of the Supreme Court, he was in full
practice for twenty-three years, affirmed to me, since the
death of Mr. Badger, that in dialectic skill and argument he
excelled any individual with whom he had ever been
acquainted, not even excepting Chief Justice Marshall himself,
for that he possessed the faculty of imagination and the
capacity for illustration which Judge Marshall had not.</p>

<p>To his hospitality and kind intercourse with gentlemen of
the profession, his liberality and assistance to its junior members
(whom his gracious demeanor and familiar manners won,
no less than his spirited and intelligent conversation entertained
and improved), to his unselfish and genial nature, and
an integrity on which no temptation ever brought a stain,
the occasion permits time only to allude before closing our
view of his professional life. Had he been called to the office
of Attorney-General of the United States by General Jackson
at the period of his first election (of which Mr. Badger had
been an ardent and efficient advocate), as many of his friends
entertained expectation, and had continued from that time his
practice in the Supreme Court of the United States, it is hazarding
but little to say that his fame would have equaled that
of any advocate in the history of American jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Badger's brief service at the head of the Navy Department&mdash;excepting
his recommendation of the establishment
of a home squadron to patrol the Gulf of Mexico and West
Indian seas, as a protection against piracy or any sudden hostile
demonstration on our coasts (a measure since adopted)&mdash;there
is no circumstance demanding especial notice. He had accepted
the appointment at the request of President Harrison
with reluctance, retained it by the expressed desire of his
successor, and resigned it as soon as the breach between Mr.
Tyler and the party that elected him was found to be irreparable.</p>

<p>Equally unsought and unexpected was his election to the
Senate of the United States when absent from the seat of government
on a professional errand beyond the sphere of his
usual practice. He entered the Senate in the first year of the
war with Mexico and held his seat throughout the struggle
which ensued over the introduction of slavery into the Territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
acquired by the treaty of peace, a struggle which was
then threatening the dissolution of the Union; he held his
seat during the compromise measures of 1850, under the
leadership of Clay; the election of General Taylor; the succession
of Fillmore; the election of Pierce and the first half
of his term, including the organization of territorial government
in Kansas and Nebraska, a period of more fierce, convulsive
and (as the sequel has proved) fatal party agitation
than any in American history except the years that have succeeded
it. Even now, after the dreadful chastening that all
have received from recent calamity, it is difficult to recur
to it without reviving passions inconsistent with the solemnities
of the hour and the charities inspired by common suffering.</p>

<p>In this struggle it was maintained on the one hand that
inasmuch as these acquisitions of territory had been made by
the common contribution of men and means from all the
States, the citizens of any State were at liberty to emigrate
and settle upon them, and to carry any property they might
possess, including slaves; that this was the case by virtue of
the operation of the Constitution over the new territory
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proprio vigore</i>. It was further declared that Congress had no
authority to legislate in contravention of this right; and, in
the progress of the dispute, this latter position, was extended
into the assumption that it was the duty of Congress to enact
laws to ensure it, and that a failure in this was a breach of
Constitutional duty so gross as to justify the injured States
in withdrawing from the Union, a power which, it was declared,
every State held in reservation, and might exercise
at pleasure, the Constitution being but a compact having no
sanctions for its perpetuation. On the other hand, there had
been for years at the North a party organization, not numerous
at first, but which at this period had swollen into a formidable
power, whose avowed object was the extinction of
slavery; which had denounced the Constitution, so far as it
upheld or tolerated it, as a covenant with the infernal powers;
had absolved themselves from its maintenance in this particular,
and avowed their preference for a disruption of the
Union unless slavery should be abolished in the Territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and States as well. More moderate men in that section, while
not agreeing with these extremists, denied emphatically either
that the Constitution gave to slavery a footing in the Territories
or bound Congress to maintain, or not interfere with,
its existence there; and that in the exercise of a legislative
discretion they might encourage, tolerate or forbid it; the
great majority favoring its prohibition in the Territories,
while they held themselves bound to non-interference in the
States.</p>

<p>In this conflict a third party arose, which affirmed that Congress
had no power over the question in the Territories; that
the people who settled in those distant regions were entitled
(not only when applying for admission into the Union as a
State, but whenever organized into a Territory, or at any
time thereafter) to determine on the establishment or rejection
of slavery as well as all other questions of domestic policy;
and by consequence, that the whole history of the Government
in the regulation of its Territories had been an error.</p>

<p>Either of the contending parties was accustomed to tolerate
very considerable aberrations, and even heresies against its
creed, to acquire or preserve party ascendancy, or to achieve
success in a Presidential election; to which latter object no
concessions and no sacrifices were deemed excessive. And the
flame on the main topic was probably fanned by many, on
both sides, with a view to the marshalling of forces for this
quadrennial contest for power and patronage. Be this as it
may, never were themes presented for sectional parties so well
adapted to deepen and widen the opened breach between them,
or pressed with more intensity or zeal. In the ardor of the
contest, old landmarks were discarded and old friends repudiated,
if not found in accordance with new positions assumed
in its progress. William Pinkney, the great champion of
Southern interests, at the period of the Missouri question, was
pronounced an abolitionist on the floor of the Senate by the
highest Southern authority, and the doors of Faneuil Hall
were closed against Daniel Webster by the authorities of
Boston, for words of truth, soberness, and conciliation, spoken
in the Senate; and this while Clay (once so much deferred to
by them as a party leader) sat by, admiring and encouraging
every sentence Webster uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Between these excited parties, Mr. Badger stood approved
by neither. As far back as the Mexican war, perceiving, as
he thought, the dangers to flow from the adjustment of the
interests of slavery, provided conquests should be made and
new territories acquired, he had repeatedly endeavored to
bring the war to a close and to bar out those dangers to the
Union, by abstaining from the acquisition of new domains,
while the fierce contestants were both eager for extensive conquests&mdash;the
one with the flattering, but delusive, hope of expanding
the area of slavery, the other with the settled purpose
to apply to all such conquests the Wilmot Proviso and to
exclude slavery.</p>

<p>When peace came with those splendid acquisitions of territory,
so gratifying to the national pride, he was not disappointed
in discovering in them an apple of discord which was
to prove fatal to tranquillity at home. In the contention
which was thus inaugurated, he steadily supported the rights
of his own section, maintaining the justice and expediency of
opening the Territories to all emigrants, without restriction
as to any species of property. In an argument, replete with
scriptural learning, he defended the servitude existing in the
South, under the name of slavery, as not inconsistent with the
divine law, more than justified by Jewish precedents, and
not forbidden by the benignant teachings of the Saviour of
the world, who found in the Roman Empire, at His coming,
and left without condemnation, a system of far greater severity.
He reminded Northern Senators of the responsibility
of their ancestors for the introduction and establishment of
slavery in this country&mdash;ours being but purchasers from them,
at second hand, for a consideration vastly greater than they
had paid; the profits being the foundation of much of their
wealth, which their consciences did not forbid them to retain.
He brought home to their sense of duty and of honor the
obligation to maintain the Constitution, so long as it remained
the Constitution, in all its parts, as well those which, as individuals,
they disapproved as those to which they assented.
If any representative of the South urged any or all of these
considerations in favor of the rights of his section, with more
earnestness and ability than Mr. Badger, it is some one whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
argument has not fallen under my observation. But he refused
to go further. He refused to argue that Congress had
no constitutional power to legislate on the subject of slavery
in the Territories. He discussed the question with boldness,
and adduced a decision of the Supreme Court, announced in
an opinion of Judge Marshall, to the effect that the power did
exist; and therefore, he addressed his appeals to the legislative
discretion of Congress. For this he incurred the disapprobation
of the extreme advocates of Southern interests. But his
opinion on the question had been deliberately formed, and
though he maintained that the exclusion of the Southern
emigrant with his peculiar property from these Territories
would be an unjust exercise and abuse of power, he declined
to make what he believed to be a false issue, in pronouncing
it unconstitutional. He dealt with the whole subject
in the interest of peace, in subordination to the Constitution,
in the hope of allaying excitement, and with an earnest
desire for continued Union. He therefore gladly co-operated
with his old political associates, Clay, Webster, Pearce of
Maryland, Bell, Mangum, Berrien, Dawson, as well as his
Democratic opponents, Cass, Douglas, Dickinson, Foote and
other compatriots of both parties, in the well-remembered
measures of the Compromise of 1850, which calmed the waves
of agitation, and promised a lasting repose from this disturbing
element&mdash;an effect which was fully realized, with an
occasional exception of resistance to the law providing for the
surrender of fugitive slaves&mdash;until the unfortunate revival of
the quarrel by the repeal, in 1854 (in the law for the organization
of the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska) of the
provision of the Missouri Compromise, by which slavery was
restricted from extending north of thirty-six degrees thirty
minutes, the southern boundary of Missouri. His participation
in this measure of repeal, Mr. Badger regarded as the
most serious error of his public life. He lived to see consequences
flow from it which he had not contemplated, and publicly
expressed his regret that he had given it his support.
Not on the ground of any breach of faith, for, as he amply
demonstrated in his speech on the passage of the measure, the
Representatives of the North in Congress had, in the Oregon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Territorial bill, as well as in other instances, demonstrated
that they attached to it no sanctity. Yet many good men
among their constituents did&mdash;and politicians who had, since
the settlement of 1850, found "their occupation gone,"
eagerly welcomed this new theme for agitation. The experience
of climate, labor, and production, had shown that African
slavery could not be attended with profit north of this parallel,
and the repeal was regarded as a flout, defiance, and aggression
which provoked the resentment of thousands who had
never before co-operated with that extreme faction which conspired
the destruction of slavery in despite of the Constitution.
Followed up as this measure was by the impotent attempt to
enforce protection to the institution in Kansas, where it
neither did, nor could exist without unreasonable aid (which
attempt was made after Mr. Badger left the Senate, and in
which there is no reason to believe he would have concurred),
it aroused an opposition, which, when embodied in the organization
of party, was irresistible. He was no propagandist of
slavery, though all the affections of his home and heart seconded
the efforts of his great mind in defending it as an institution
of the country recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution
of the United States. He was too sagacious to
believe it could be benefited in any way by provoking the
shock of civil war, and too truthful and patriotic to trifle with
it as a means of rallying parties or subserving any of the
interests of faction. In voting for the repeal of the Missouri
restriction, he looked upon it as having been overvalued
in its practical importance at first, abandoned by the North as
effete, if not disregarded from the beginning, and its removal
out of the way as but conforming the system of territorial
law to that part of the Compromise of 1850 pertaining to the
Territories, which left the adoption or rejection of slavery to
be decided by the inhabitants when framing a constitution,
preparatory to their admission as a State of the Union; not
anticipating the recoil in public sentiment, which was the
first step in the overthrow of slavery itself.</p>

<p>I have been thus tedious in the review of the history of
this period because it was upon topics arising out of this
great subject of controversy, ever uppermost in the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
mind, that Mr. Badger made his most frequent and probably
most elaborate efforts in the Senate, and for the further reason
that in the heated atmosphere of the time his opinions as
expressed and the moderation of his course were, by some,
supposed to imply indifference to the interests of his section.
Time and disaster are not unfrequently necessary to vindicate
true wisdom.</p>

<p>He was as averse to the details of revenue and finance as
Charles James Fox, and could probably have united with that
statesman in the declaration that he had never read a treatise
on political economy. But on all subjects pertaining to general
policy, or to the history, jurisprudence, or Constitution
of the country, he commanded a deference yielded to scarcely
any other individual, after the withdrawal of Mr. Webster;
and as a speaker and writer of English, according to the testimony
of Judge Butler, of South Carolina, he had no peer in
the Senate, save Webster.</p>

<p>He delighted in repeating the rule for the construction of
the Constitution, which he had heard enunciated by Judge
Marshall in the Circuit Court for North Carolina. "The
Constitution of the United States," said he, "is to be construed
not <em>strictly</em>, not <em>loosely</em>, but <em>honestly</em>. The powers
granted should be freely exercised to effect the objects of the
grant, while there should be a careful abstinence from the
assumption of any not granted, but reserved." With this
simple rule for his guide, with an innate love of truth and
wonderful perspicacity in its discernment, with an ethics which
permitted no paltering in deference to the authority or suggestion
of faction, his arguments on constitutional questions
were models of moral demonstration. Such was the confidence
reposed in his accuracy and candor on questions of this
nature, that his opinions were sought, for practical guidance,
alike by friends and opponents. And such was the personal
favor and kindness entertained towards him by all his associates
that at the expiration of his term the rare compliment
was paid him of expressing regret at his departure by an
unanimous vote of the Senate.</p>

<p>After ceasing to be a Senator he held, until the commencement
of the late calamitous war, the place of one of the Regents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of the Smithsonian Institution. In his professional
visits to Washington, until the interruption of intercourse by
that dire event, and in all his correspondence with public men,
he never departed from that course of moderation and peace
on the exciting subject of the times which had characterized
him as a Senator, joined heartily in the movement of his old
Whig friends for the organization of a Constitutional Union
party to abate the violence of faction which was too surely
tending to disunion, and to make an appeal to the people to
rescue the country from the impending peril. The result of
this movement was the nomination of Bell and Everett for
the first offices of the government; and Mr. Badger accepted
the nomination for Elector on this ticket, and visited various
parts of North Carolina, addressing the people in its
support. In these addresses, with the frankness which belonged
to his nature, he freely admitted that there was a strong
probability of the election of Mr. Lincoln, not merely from
a division of votes among three other candidates, but from the
strength of his party in the Northern States, founded on the
principle of opposition to slavery; and he charged, that in that
event, it was the design of a large portion of the supporters of
Mr. Breckinridge to attempt to destroy the Union by the
secession of the Southern States, and that there was reason
to believe his defeat and the election of Mr. Lincoln were
desired by this latter class, because of the opportunity it would
afford for a dissolution of the Union, a purpose which they
had long cherished. While, therefore, he advocated the election
of Mr. Bell, he conjured the people, no matter who
might be elected, to acquiesce in the decision and give no
countenance to secession. Although, with the exception of a
small faction, the people were averse to disunion, the majority
were persuaded that this was an overstatement of the case,
and cast their votes for Mr. Breckinridge, as they usually did
for the party nominee.</p>

<p>When the election was past, and the proceedings which
immediately followed in other States verified Mr. Badger's
anticipations, the people began to turn to him, and those of
like opinions, for guidance in the future. And, to persons
in distant parts of the Union, it is, no doubt, a matter of mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
how he, with all his antecedents in favor of Union, became
involved in war against the Government of the United
States. The case of Mr. Badger, in this particular, is the
case of at least three-fourths of the people of the State (for
they relied upon his counsels for their action quite as much as
upon those of any other individual) and requires a word of
explanation. Notwithstanding the long and acrimonious disputations
which had been carried on in Congress and at the
hustings, and the sentiments declared in opposition to slavery
by Mr. Lincoln and his supporters, Mr. Badger maintained
that his election afforded no sufficient cause for a resort to revolution&mdash;as
to the right, claimed, of a State to secede, he had
never for a moment believed in it or given it the least countenance&mdash;that
the accession of such a party to power would
require increased vigilance over the rights and interests of the
South; but that the majority in Congress was not lost to us,
if the members from all the Southern States would remain
and be faithful, and that the judiciary was open to any just
complaint, even if the Executive should attempt aggression.
After every State south of North Carolina to the confines of
Mexico had adopted ordinances of secession, the people of this
State rejected a proposition to call a convention to consider
the question.</p>

<p>But when Virginia, our neighbor on the northern frontier,
also withdrew, and Tennessee on the west had taken measures
for the same object, when war had been actually begun, no
matter by whose rashness or folly, and the only alternatives
presented were in the choice of the side we should espouse,
considerations of national or State interest, safety and necessity
(such as are not unfrequently forced upon the decision of
neutrals by the conduct of belligerents not connected under
the same government) at once occurred, and were obliged to
be weighed with the obligations of constitutional duty. Our
borders were surrounded on all sides, except that washed by
the ocean, by seceded States. Our youth must go forth to
battle with or against these States. The Union we had so long
and so sincerely cherished, was a Union in its integrity; and
next to that, and as a part of it, was a Union with neighboring
States, in which were our kindred and most intimate friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and identical institutions. Slavery, whatever may be thought
of it elsewhere or now, constituted more than one-half of our
individual and public wealth. It had paid our taxes, built
our railroads, reared our seminaries of education and charity,
and was intimately connected with the order and repose of
our society. Withal, in the acrimony of a long quarrel, its
maintenance had become a point of honor. In the actual
posture of affairs, which promised to continue while the war
lasted, instead of fifteen States in which slavery existed, whose
Representatives were to maintain a common interest in the
halls of Congress, there were to be but three, or at most, four,
and all these, except our own, with a minor interest in the
system. A civil war which threatened to be sanguinary and
protracted, kindled avowedly for the protection of slavery, was
not likely to end in the defeat of the insurgent States without
the destruction of the institution in them, and after no long
time, in the adhering States, also. Though far from approving
the course of the recusant States, victory on the side of
those who held the reins of government could not inure in
benefit, nor without serious disaster, to us.</p>

<p>These ties of blood, vicinity, institutions and interests, the
desire to avoid internecine strife among our own people (which
must have been immediately precipitated by a zealous
minority, with the local government, legislative and executive,
in their hands) impelled Mr. Badger, and those who
acted with him, to decline to take up arms against their own
section in favor of the distant authority of the national government,
and as a consequence to unite with those whose
action they had deprecated and endeavored to prevent, and
with whom they had had little sympathy or cooperation in
the politics of the past. The support of the undertaking, if
concurred in by all the slaveholding States, which was confidently
represented to be certain, appeared to afford hope of
a safer and better future than its suppression by force. The
determination of the question, as I know, occasioned him
pain and embarrassment, but when made it was firmly maintained.
He accepted a seat in the Convention which passed
the ordinance declaring the separation of the State from the
Federal Union, and gave to this ordinance his sanction; not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
however, without a distinct declaration of his disbelief in the
doctrine of secession as a constitutional right. He also sustained
measures for the prosecution of a vigorous war, as, in
his conception, the surest and shortest way to peace, but was
ever vigilant of the dignity and just rights of the State, the
encroachments of the military authority, the jurisdiction of
the civil tribunals and the protection and liberty of the citizens.
He sought no patronage or favor for himself or his
family. His sons served in the ranks of the army and bore
their part in the perils and adventures of war.</p>

<p>While it yet raged, he was stricken by the hand of disease,
which partially obscured his faculties and withdrew him from
public view. He survived, however, until after the return of
peace, and in the twilight of mind, with which he was yet
favored, rejoiced in the deliverance of the country from the
calamities of war, and very sincerely acquiesced in a return to
his allegiance to the Government of the United States.</p>

<p>These observations on the professional and public life of the
subject of our sketch have been so prolonged that the occasion
will permit but a few further remarks upon his general
attainments, his intellectual and moral character and usefulness
as a citizen. It was the remark of Lord Bacon that
"Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, and
writing an exact man." Mr. Badger's reading was confined,
with the exception of the dead languages, which he
had acquired in his youthful studies, to the literature of our
own language. With the most approved authors in this he
had a familiar acquaintance, and, as already remarked, excelled
in the accomplishments of a critic. The field of learning,
which next to jurisprudence he most affected, and perhaps
even preferred to that, was moral science. Upon the sublime
truths of this science, in the conversations with his friends,
his remarks and illustrations were often not unworthy of Alexander
or Wayland, Butler or Whately. "In it," says one of
the most intimate of his friends and contemporaries, "the
rapidity of his perception and accuracy of his deductions were
marvelous. Place before his mind any proposition of moral
science, and instantly he carried it out, either to exact truth,
most beautifully enunciated, or reduced it to an absurdity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
To his acquisitions in the kindred topic of didactic divinity,
or theology as a science, only a professional theologian can do
justice. An earnest member of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, though but a layman, he ventured on more than one
occasion to discuss matters of discipline and doctrine in the
character of a pamphleteer, in opposition to clergymen of
note, and in a memorable instance with the head of the diocese
himself with such signal success that, although the Bishop
ultimately united himself with the Romish Church, whither
Mr. Badger charged that he was tending, not another member
of his denomination left its communion.</p>

<p>He was averse to the labor of writing, and beyond an
address before the Literary Societies of the University, the
reports, by his own hand, of some of his speeches in Congress,
and other pamphlets on subjects political or religious, has
left few written performances. But he had the accuracy in
thought and speech of a practiced writer.</p>

<p>In conversation he realized in the fullest sense Bacon's idea
of readiness, and shone with a lustre rarely equaled. The
activity and playfulness of his thoughts and the gayety of his
disposition inclined him to paradox and repartee to such a degree
that his conversation was oftentimes but amusing levity.
But in a moment it rose to the profoundest reflection and most
fascinating eloquence. His knowledge was ever at instantaneous
command, as it was far more the result of his own meditations
than of acquisition from others, and fancy lent her
aid in giving a grandeur to his conceptions on all the subjects
of his grave discourse. After all the public displays in which
he enchained the attention of judges, jurors, senators, and
promiscuous assemblies with equal admiration and delight, it
is a matter for doubt, among those who knew him well,
whether his brightest thoughts and most felicitous utterances,
the versatility of his genius, and the vast range of his contemplations
were not oftener witnessed in his boon and social
hours, in the converse of friends, around his own hospitable
board, or at the village inn, or on a public highway&mdash;all without
pedantry or apparent effort, "as if he stooped to touch
the loftiest thought"&mdash;than in these elaborate and studied
exhibitions. He affected no mystery, and wore no mask, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
stood ready in familiar colloquy to make good, by new and
apt illustrations, any sentiment advanced in formal argument,
or to abandon it as untenable if satisfied of error.</p>

<p>His reverence for truth, to which allusion has been already
made in the course of these observations, was even above his
intellectual powers, his most striking characteristic. He was
accustomed to speak of it "as the most distinguished attribute
of God himself, and the love of it as giving to one moral
being an eminence above another." To its discovery he delighted
to apply the powers of his remarkable intellect, to its
influence he was ready to surrender his most cherished convictions
whenever found to be erroneous.</p>

<p>The fruits of this were seen in the crowning virtues of his
character: he was a Christian of humble and intelligent piety
without intolerance toward others, a lawyer without chicanery
or artifice, a statesman without being a factionist, a party
man above the low arts of the demagogue, a gentleman and
citizen enlightened, social, charitable, liberal, impressing his
character upon the manners and morals of his times, ready to
render aid in every good and noble work, and prompt to
resist and repel any evil influence, no matter by what array
of numbers, power or vitiated public opinion supported. I
have known no man to whose moral courage may be more
fitly applied the ideal of the Latin poet, as rendered in free
translation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The man whose mind on virtue bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues some greatly good intent<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With undiverted aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serene beholds the angry crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can their clamors fierce and loud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His stubborn honor tame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the proud tyrant's fiercest threat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor storms, that from their dark retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rolling surges wake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Jove's dread bolt that shakes the pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The firmer purpose of his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With all its power can shake."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the latter years of his life, actuated by a desire to be
useful in his day and generation, wherever opportunity and
his ability might allow, he accepted the office of justice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
peace, an office which, to the honor of those who have filled it
in North Carolina from the first organization of civil government
until now, has ever been performed without pecuniary
reward, and took considerable interest in administering justice
in the County Courts of Wake, giving to this inferior tribunal
the dignity and value of a Superior Court, to the great satisfaction
of the bar and the public.</p>

<p>He was thrice married; first, as before mentioned, to the
daughter of Governor Turner; second, to the daughter of
Colonel William Polk, and third, to Mrs. Delia Williams,
daughter of Sherwood Haywood, Esq., in each instance forming
an alliance with an old family of the State, distinguished
by public service and great personal worth from an early
period. The last named lady, the worthy companion of his
life for thirty years, who survives him as his widow, receives
in her bereavement the condolence and sympathy, not merely
of this community and State, but that of those in distant lands
and in other States of the Union whom, not the lapse of years
nor the excitement of intervening events, nor the fiery gulf
of civil war shall separate from a friendship accorded to her
and her departed husband, as representatives of the personal
character, the society and domestic virtues of their native
State in better days of the republic. By the two latter marriages
he left numerous descendants.</p>

<p>While taking his accustomed walk at an early hour in the
morning of January 5, 1863, he was prostrated by a paralytic
stroke, near the mineral spring in the environs of the city of
Raleigh, and although retaining his self-possession and ability
to converse until assistance was kindly furnished, on the way
home his mind wandered, and before reaching his residence
his faculty of continuous speech deserted him, never again to
return. His mental powers after a brief interval rallied, insomuch
that he took pleasure in reading and in listening to the
conversations of friends, whose visits afforded him much satisfaction;
and, with assistance, he could walk for exercise in the
open air; but was never afterwards able to command language,
except for brief sentences, failing often in these to
convey his full meaning. In this condition he lingered until
the 11th of May, 1866, when, after a few days' illness from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
renewed attacks of the same nature, he expired, having recently
completed his seventy-first year.</p>

<p>My task is done. I have endeavored but "to hold the mirror
up to nature." If the image reflected appears, in any of
its features, magnified, it was not so intended. Yet the
memory of a friendship, dating back to kind offices and notice
in my student-life, extending through all my active manhood,
may not have been without its influence in giving color
to the picture. But the character in our contemplation was
of no ordinary proportions. At the bar of the State he wore
the mantle of Gaston and Archibald Henderson for a much
longer period than either, worthily and well, with no diminution
of its honors. In the highest court of the Union he was the
acknowledged compeer of Webster, Crittenden, Ewing, Johnson,
Berrien, Walker and Cushing. That he did not sit in
the highest seat of justice in the State and nation, as proposed
successively by the Executive of each, is imputable to
no deficiency or unworthiness for the station, his adversaries
being judges. In the Senate, when Clay, Webster, and Calhoun
still remained there, not to name others of scarcely
inferior repute, he was among the foremost, upholding the
rights of his own State and section with manliness and ability,
but with candor, moderation, and true wisdom, which sought
to harmonize conflicting elements and avert the calamities of
civil strife. In morals he was inflexible, without stain or suspicion
of vice; in manners and social intercourse, genial,
frank, hospitable, with colloquial powers to instruct, amuse,
and fascinate alike, and "with a heart open as day to melting
charity." The fame of such a man is a source of natural and
just pride to the people of the State. This sentiment is that
which the poet describes in the Englishman, when he sings</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is enough to satisfy the ambition of a private man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Chatham's language was his mother tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How much he will be missed as a member of the community,
as the friend of order and law, religion and morality,
as a professional man, counsellor, and advocate of unrivalled
ability and reputation, as an intellectual and cultivated man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with armor bright and powers ever at his command, presenting
a model for the emulation of our ingenuous youth, as a public
character, as adviser and true friend, but no flatterer of the
people, and an unflinching supporter of their rights, wherever
truth and duty might lead, time and experience may demonstrate.
There is no public aspect, however, in which his loss
is so much to be deplored as in the relation he bore to the past,
and his probable efficiency in solving the problem of the day.
Who so capable of interpreting the Constitution which forms
our government, and the alleged laws of war by which it is
claimed to be suspended or superseded, as that gifted mind
and sincere nature, so trusted on these topics in former years,
and so thoroughly imbued with the spirit and teachings of
Marshall? Who so deserving to be heard on the best means
of pacification and reestablishment of order and right among
thirty-five millions of freemen as he who, by his temperance,
calmness, and intelligent constitutional opinions, in the commencement
of our national difficulties, incurred the censure of
many in our own section of country, without receiving the approbation
of their adversaries? Who so fitted for the exposure
and correction of error, of allaying the ignoble passions of
hatred and revenge, and rekindling the national affections inspired
by a common and honorable history? Who so skillful to
remove the scales from the eyes that will not see, and who
so wise and brave to rebuke the age of faction, threatening to
realize the assertion of Mr. Fox, in his history of James II.,
that "the most dangerous of all revolutions is a restoration?"</p>

<p>To that good Being, in whose hands are the destinies of
nations and individuals, by whose divine agency crooked paths
are often made straight and issue granted out of all troubles,
in ways not visible to human eyes, let us unite in commending
every interest of our beloved country.</p>

<p>The foregoing sketch, in the form of an address on the life
and character of George E. Badger, was delivered in Raleigh,
July 19, 1866, at the request of the Wake county bar.
Though much of it is not strictly biographical, it is interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
on account of its distinguished author, as well as for giving
us a view of the times and events discussed.</p>

<p>The address delivered by Mr. Badger at the State University
in June, 1833, before the two Literary Societies, is said,
by those who heard him on other occasions, not to afford a
fair illustration of his great powers as a speaker. He was in
fact never a florid orator, powerful to move the passions above
reason, but his mind was so clear, his manner so unhesitating,
his knowledge so great, his flow of language so easy, his
memory so accurate, and his presence so commanding that he
was bound to make a powerful impression whenever he spoke
to men in public or in private.</p>

<p>He was not greatest as a statesman&mdash;he had his run in the
technical learning of the law too long&mdash;statesmen must be
early and specially trained and educated in the business of
statecraft.</p>

<p>He was too reserved, austere at times, and perhaps sensitive,
ever to win the affections of men in the same proportion that
his great talents commanded their respect and admiration.</p>

<p>His short tribute to Judge Gaston, hereto subjoined, is valuable
for the purpose for which it was uttered, and as a fair sample
of his style, showing his choice of words, in easy command,
when occasion called them forth. Judge Gaston died
in January, 1844, and, at the meeting held in honor of his
memory, Mr. Badger said: "This meeting of the members
of the bar of the Supreme Court has learned with profound
grief the melancholy and totally unexpected bereavement
which the Court and the country have sustained in the death
of the Hon. William Gaston. Struck down suddenly by the
hand of God, in the midst of his judicial labors, dying as
he had lived in the enlightened and devoted service of his
country, endued by learning and adorned by eloquence with
their choicest gifts, enobled by that pure integrity and firm
and undeviating pursuit of right which only an ardent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
animating religious faith can bestow and adequately sustain,
and endeared to the hearts of all that knew him by those
virtues which diffuse over the social circle all that is cheerful,
refined, and benevolent, he has left behind him a rare and
happy memory, dear alike to his brethren, his friends, and
his country."</p>

<p>Governor Graham undertakes to set forth Mr. Badger's
reasons for finally favoring the secession of North Carolina
from the Union, but the reader will see from the subjoined resolutions
that it is best to allow Mr. Badger to speak for himself.
He and the people of North Carolina then assumed as axiomatic
that Lincoln's call for troops to invade the South was
utterly without warrant of law. Strong as was the language
of the resolutions, it was not strong enough to express the
indignation of the people at Lincoln's usurping the authority
to begin the war on his sole responsibility. Not mainly because
the institution of slavery was threatened, nor yet because
we were wedged between seceding States, but because the
people, as one man, believed that the most vital powers of a
government of three departments had been violently seized
by the Executive, that the seizure was supported by a conspiracy
of States, and that the Constitution and the Union of
the fathers were already outraged and dismembered.</p>

<p>The resolutions above alluded to, and a part of the speech
delivered in the United States Senate, March 19, 1850, instructive
in themselves, are given also as specimens of Mr.
Badger's style.</p>

<h3>ORDINANCE OF SECESSION.</h3>

<p class="center">PROPOSED BY GEO. E. BADGER.</p>

<p>"Whereas, Abraham Lincoln, of Illinois, and Hannibal
Hamlin, of Maine, were chosen President and Vice-President
of the United States by a party in fact and avowedly entirely
sectional in its organization, and hostile in its declared principles
to the institutions of the Southern States of the Union,
and thereupon certain Southern States did separate themselves
from the Union, and form another and independent
government, under the name of 'The Confederate States of
America'; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, the people of North Carolina, though justly
aggrieved by the evident tendency of this election and of
these principles, did, nevertheless, abstain from adopting any
such measures of separation, and, on the contrary, influenced
by an ardent attachment to the Union and Constitution, which
their fathers had transmitted to them, did remain in the said
Union, loyally discharging all their duties under the Constitution,
in the hope that what was threatening in public affairs
might yield to the united efforts of patriotic men from every
part of the nation, and by their efforts such guarantees for
the security of our rights might be obtained as should restore
confidence, renew alienated ties, and finally reunite all the
States in a common bond of fraternal union; meantime, cheerfully
and faithfully exerting whatever influence they possessed
for the accomplishment of this most desirable end; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, things being in this condition, and the people
of this State indulging this hope, the said Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States did, on the fifteenth day of
April, by his proclamation, call upon the States of the Union
to furnish large bodies of troops to enable him, under the
false pretense of executing the laws, to march an army into
the seceded States with a view to their subjugation, under an
arbitrary and military authority, there being no law of Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
authorizing such calling out of troops, and no constitutional
right to use them, if called out, for the purpose intended
by him; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, this call for troops has been answered throughout
the Northern, Northwestern, and Middle non-slaveholding
States with enthusiastic readiness, and it is evident, from the
tone of the entire press of those States and the open avowal
of their public men, that it is the fixed purpose of the governments
and people of those States to wage a cruel war
against the seceded States, to destroy utterly the fairest portion
of this continent, and reduce its inhabitants to absolute
subjection and abject slavery; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, in aid of these detestable plans and wicked
measures, the said Lincoln, without any shadow of rightful
authority, and in plain violation of the Constitution of the
United States, has, by other proclamations, declared the ports
of North Carolina, as well as all the other Atlantic and Gulf
States under blockade, thus seeking to cut off our trade with
all parts of the world; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, since his accession to power, the whole conduct
of said Lincoln has been marked by a succession of false, disingenuous
and treacherous acts and declarations, proving incontestably
that he is, at least in his dealings with Southern
States and Southern men, devoid of faith and honor; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, he is now governing by military rule alone,
enlarging by new enlistments of men both the military and
naval force, without any authority of law, having set aside all
constitutional and legal restraints, and made all constitutional
and legal rights dependent upon his mere pleasure and that
of his military subordinates; and</p>

<p>"Whereas, in all his unconstitutional, illegal and oppressive
acts, in all his wicked and diabolical purposes, and in his
present position of usurper and military dictator, he has been
and is encouraged and supported by the great body of the
people of the non-slaveholding States;</p>

<p>"Therefore, this convention, now here assembled in the
name and with the sovereign power of the people of North
Carolina, doth, for the reasons aforesaid, and others, and in
order to preserve the undoubted rights and liberties of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
said people, hereby declare all connection of government between
this State and the United States of America dissolved
and abrogated, and this State to be a free, sovereign, and independent
State, owing no subordination, obedience, support or
other duty to the said United States, their Constitution or
authorities, anything in her ratification of said Constitution
or of any amendment or amendments thereto to the contrary
notwithstanding; and having full power to levy war, conclude
peace, contract alliances, and to do all other acts and things
which independent States may of right do, and appealing to
the Supreme Governor of the world for the justice of our
cause, and beseeching Him for his gracious help and blessing,
we will, to the uttermost of our power and to the last extremity,
maintain, defend, and uphold this declaration."</p>

<h3><a name="SLAVERY" id="SLAVERY"></a>SPEECH ON SLAVERY AND THE UNION.</h3>

<p class="center">BY GEORGE E. BADGER.</p>

<p>I concur entirely in what has so often been said on this
floor that there can be no peaceable separation of this Union.
From the very nature of the case, from the character of our
institutions, from the character of our country, from the
nature of the government itself, it is, in my judgment, impossible
that there can be a peaceable separation of this Union.
But if there could be, I agree entirely with the honorable
Senator from Kentucky, that the state of peace in which we
should separate must be speedily ended, must terminate in
intestine conflicts, in wars, which, from the nature of the case,
could know no amicable termination, no permanent peace
but, until the superiority of the one or the other side in
the conflict should be completely established, would admit of
nothing but hollow truces, in which each might breathe from
past exertions, and make preparations for future conflicts.</p>

<p>Sir, the idea of a separation of these States into distinct
confederacies was thought of, and considered, and spoken of
before the adoption of this Constitution. At the time that
the question was before the American people, whether the
Constitution proposed by the Convention should be adopted,
it was then spoken of. It is probable&mdash;yea, certain&mdash;consequences
were referred to by the writers of that admirable
series of papers denominated the "Federalist"; and I beg
the indulgence of the Senate while I read a very brief extract,
conveying the views of those eminent men:</p>

<p>"If these States should either be wholly disunited, or only
united in partial confederacies, a man must be far gone in
utopian speculation who can seriously doubt that the subdivisions
into which they might be thrown would have frequent
and violent contests with each other. To presume a want of
motives for such contests, as an argument against their existence,
would be to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and rapacious. To look for a continuation of harmony between
a number of independent, unconnected sovereignties,
situated in the same neighborhood, would be to disregard the
uniform course of human events, and to set at defiance the
accumulated experience of ages."</p>

<p>If this was a just view of the probable&mdash;the certain&mdash;results
of a separation of these States at that time, and under
the then existing circumstances, I pray you, sir, upon what,
at the present day, can we found a better hope? Then the
States were fresh from the conflict of the Revolutionary war.
Then, not only had they a lively remembrance of the contest
in which they had fought and in which they had gathered
victory and honor together, but the leading men of that time
were those choice spirits who had carried them through that
recent conflict, who had established the independence of the
country, and who exercised an influence in public affairs proportioned
to their patriotism, their valor and their wisdom.
Then they might have separated without the same causes of
hostility and alienation which must exist in any separation
of these States at the present day. If we separate now, we
do it with feelings of mutual distrust and bitterness. We
divide, not by common consent, as partners who can no
longer carry on their joint business with mutual profit, each to
pursue, for his own separate advantage, that course of business
in which he thinks he can best succeed, but we part with
the feelings of those who consider themselves mutually
wronged. A sense of injustice and oppression rankles in the
hearts of one portion of the new confederacies, and a sense
in the other of defiance and indignity.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, "what can ensue" (to borrow
the language of the great English moralist) "but a continual
exacerbation of hatred, an unextinguishable feud, an incessant
reciprocation of mischief, a mutual vigilance to entrap
and eagerness to destroy?"</p>

<p>The question has been asked, What can the States do, supposing
them to be divided&mdash;separated into distinct subdivisions
or independent sovereignties? Allow me to answer that
question in the words of one of the most eminent men whom
my State has ever produced: a man of clear and comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
intellect, of a sound heart and enlarged and ardent
patriotism, who shed a glory around his native State, and
whose name is held in just veneration by every one who
acknowledges himself a North Carolinian. At another period
of our history the same question was asked. In the years
1831 and 1832 it had become an inquiry, a subject of disquisition
in my State, and the late Judge Gaston, in an address
delivered in 1832 before the Literary Societies of the University,
thus treats of the subject:</p>

<p>"Threats of resistance, secession, separation, have become
common as household words in the wicked and silly violence
of public declaimers. The public ear is familiarized with,
and the public mind will soon become accustomed to, the
detestable suggestion of disunion. Calculations and conjectures&mdash;what
may the East do without the South, and what
may the South do without the East?&mdash;sneers, menaces, reproaches,
and recriminations&mdash;all tend to the same fatal end.
What can the East do without the South? What can the
South do without the East? They may do much; they may
exhibit to the curiosity of political anatomists, and the pity
and wonder of the world, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</i>&mdash;the sundered,
bleeding limbs of a once gigantic body instinct with life, and
strength, and vigor. They can furnish to the philosophic
historian another melancholy and striking instance of the
political axiom, that all republican confederacies have an inherent
and unavoidable tendency to dissolution. They will
present fields and occasions for border wars, for leagues and
counter leagues, for the intrigues of petty statesmen and the
struggles of military chiefs, for confiscations, insurrections,
and deeds of darkest hue. They will gladden the hearts of
those who have proclaimed that men are not fit to govern
themselves, and shed a disastrous eclipse on the hopes of
rational freedom throughout the world. Solon, in his code,
proposed no punishment for parricide, treating it as an impossible
crime. Such, with us, ought to be the crime of political
parricide&mdash;the dismemberment of our 'fatherland.'"</p>

<p>To me, sir, these sentiments convey a just representation
of what will be the future and unavoidable result of a separation
of the people of this great country into distinct and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
independent confederacies. And when I look at the prospect
before us it is one so dark, filled with such horrid forms of
dread and evil, that I willingly close my eyes upon it, and
desire to believe that it is impossible it should ever be realized.
* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>Nor, Mr. President, must I forget that, in considering the
effect which this proviso [the Wilmot Proviso] is likely to
have upon the condition of the Southern mind, we must look
to what has been said by Northern gentlemen in connection
with this subject. Permit me to call the attention of the
Senate to a very brief extract from a speech delivered in the
other end of the Capitol:</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I have only to add, that such is my solemn
and abiding conviction of the character of slavery, that, under
a full sense of my responsibility to my country and my God,
I <em>deliberately</em> say, better disunion, better a civil or a servile
war, better anything that God in His providence shall send,
than an extension of the bounds of slavery."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Several Senators.</span> Whose speech is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Senator.</span> Mr. Mann's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Badger.</span> We have heard much, Mr. President, of
the violence of Southern declamation. I have most carefully
avoided reading the speeches of Southern gentlemen who
were supposed to be liable to that charge. I happened, however,
in the early part of this session, and before the other
house was organized, to be in that body when there were
some bursts of feeling and denunciation from Southern gentlemen,
which I heard with pain, mortification, almost with
anguish of mind. But, sir, these were bursts of feeling; these
were passionate and excited declarations; these had everything
to plead for them as being spontaneous and fiery ebullitions
of men burning at the moment under a sense of wrong. And
where, among these, will you find anything equal to the cool,
calm, deliberate announcement of the philosophic mind that
delivered in the other house the passage which I have read:
"Better disunion, better a civil or a servile war, better anything
that God in His providence shall send, than an extension
of the bounds of slavery?" In other words, it is the
deliberate, settled, fixed opinion of the honorable gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
who made that speech, that rather than the extension of the
bounds of slavery <em>one foot</em>&mdash;yes, sir, there is no qualification,
<em>one foot</em>&mdash;he would prefer a disunion of these States, he would
prefer all the horrors of civil war, all the monstrous, untold,
and almost inconceivable atrocities of a servile war, he would
pile the earth with dead, he would light up heaven with midnight
conflagrations; all this&mdash;yea, and more&mdash;all the vials
of wrath which God in His providence might see fit to pour
down on us he would suffer, rather than permit, not one man
who is now free to be made a slave&mdash;that would be extravagant
enough&mdash;but rather than permit one man who now
stands upon the soil of North Carolina a slave, to stand a
slave upon the soil of New Mexico!</p>

<p>Yes, sir, here is a sacrifice of life and happiness, and of all
that is dear to the black and white races together, to a mere
idealism&mdash;a sacrifice proposed by a gentleman who claims to
be a philosopher, and to speak the language of calm deliberation,
a sacrifice of our glorious Union proposed by a patriot,
not rather than freemen should be made slaves, not rather
than the condition of even one human being should be made
worse than it now is, but rather than one man shall remove
from one spot of the earth to another without an improvement
of his condition, without passing from slavery to freedom!
Sir, after that announcement thus made, which I beg
to say, sir, I did not seek&mdash;for the speech I have never read&mdash;the
extract I found in one of the newspapers of the day&mdash;after
that announcement, talk not of Southern violence, talk not
of Southern egotism, talk not of our disposition to sacrifice
to our peculiar notions and our peculiar relations the peace
and happiness, the growing prosperity, and the mutual concord
of this great Union. Now, sir, if that announcement
goes abroad into the Southern country, attended by this wanton
application of the Wilmot Proviso, an irritating commentary
upon that patriotic announcement, what can be expected?
What but the deepest emotions of indignation in the bosoms
of those born and brought up where slavery exists, and taking
totally different views of the institution from those which
are taken by the honorable gentleman who has placed himself
in this cool and deliberate, humane, and philosophical position!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir, we know, with regard to two or more of the Southern
States, emphatic pledges have been given, through their Legislatures,
that <em>some</em> mode of resistance to this proviso will be
adopted. Now, what is to be the result of the Nashville
Convention which has been called for June next, should that
body assemble and find matters in their present condition?
If no bill shall have passed to do us justice by affording, as
far as the law can afford it, the effectual restoration of fugitive
slaves; if a bill shall have passed, or be likely to pass, with the
insult of the Wilmot Proviso causelessly and wantonly inserted
in it, after the announcement made in the extract of the
speech which I have just read, and after that made by the
Senator from New York that so far from there being an
obligation to restore to us our fugitive slaves, the duty of
hospitality requires that they shall be received, kept and retained
from us and that the constitutional law which requires
their restoration to us is contrary to the law of God, and not
binding in conscience; and, still more, after the settled policy
is fully realized that those who visit our shores, coming under
the protection of the American flag within our jurisdiction,
and, in violation of our laws, seduce our slaves from us, and
carry them to the North, shall not be surrendered up as fugitives
from justice, because the same high and overruling law
which puts the Constitution down, and makes it a nullity,
has converted what we call a crime into a high and meritorious
act of duty, what will be the result of this convention,
meeting under such circumstances, what may be, what probably
will be, the consequence? I say it not because I wish
it, I do not wish it; the conviction has been forced upon my
mind by evidence reluctantly received; and therefore I wish
my friends around me to give, for that reason, the more credit
to what I say&mdash;if that convention shall meet under such
circumstances, in my judgment the Union is from that day
dissolved. I do not say that dissolution will follow instantly;
I do not say but that a connection, an external Union, may not
be maintained, and linger on for a few years longer: but the
meeting of that convention will be to our institutions, in the
language of Napoleon, "the beginning of the end"; it will
be the initiative step in such a course of measures, North and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
South, as will result in convulsing us so far that the ills to
which we fly, cannot, in our judgment, exceed those we bear;
and thus will be put upon the people of the South the necessity,
the painful, hard necessity, of a dissolution, a final separation.
Now, sir, why do I take this view? In the first place,
the meeting of the Nashville Convention is, upon its face, a
step towards a separate and distinct organization of the Southern
States. The very movement separates them for a time, in
purposes and intent, from the great mass of the population
of the country. They meet there for what purpose? To
consider, to deliberate, to debate&mdash;what? What course of
action shall, by mutual agreement, be taken by the States
whom this convention will represent, what manner of resistance,
what mode of redress? Now, sir, in all matters of this
kind, in all revolutions, in all dissolutions of the ties which
bind us together, the first step is the great difficulty. It is
so even in social and private life; it is so in the married state.
The first wanton and public outrage on the part of one
towards the other of the parties is easily followed by such
steps as end in total and thorough estrangement. Well, then,
suppose no measures are proposed which look to a separation
of the Union, as I have no reason to suppose that any will
be proposed looking to that as an object, I fully believe that
that convention in Mississippi which terminated its session in
the call for this convention was influenced by high and
patriotic motives, seeking to preserve and not to destroy the
Union. If I wanted anything to satisfy me of that (besides
other reasons which I have), the very fact that the convention
was presided over by the venerable and venerated Chief Justice
Sharkey, a most learned jurist and patriotic gentleman,
would be sufficient for me. But when we have ascertained
what people design by any particular movement, we are far,
very far, from having ascertained what they may accomplish
by it. Now, suppose this meeting should resolve that, by a
common concurrence of the States represented, laws should
be passed, police regulations be adopted, in those States, of
the most irritating and offensive kind towards the Northern
portion of the Union: such a course will not appear surprising,
if we bear in mind the fact that slaves are constantly taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
from our ports by vessels that visit them for the purpose of
commerce; that, thus taken, they are withheld from us, and
their seducers are neither discountenanced at home, nor restored
to us for punishment; and that a flagrant wrong on
one side naturally provokes to measures at once of protection
and retaliation from the other. But, Mr. President, the
moment these States, by mutual compact and agreement,
have come to a resolution to adopt a particular course of measures
upon this subject, they have left the platform of the
Constitution; they are no longer upon it, because the Constitution
expressly forbids a State to enter into any compact
or agreement with another State without the consent of Congress.
When this first step is taken, the process is easy and
need not be traced to a final dissolution of our present Union:
and, therefore, in the event of the meeting of this convention,
with the slavery question in the situation I have mentioned,
I have, I repeat, gloomy apprehensions of what may be, and
most probably will be the result upon the destinies of our
country. Force, Mr. President, cannot keep the States of
this Union together, cannot preserve the constitutional Union.
I distinctly admit what has been said by the honorable Senator
from Massachusetts [Mr. Webster], that no State has a
<em>right</em> to secede from this Union. I distinctly admit that the
Constitution, looking to perpetuity, makes no provision directly
or indirectly, for the separation of its parts. But, in
point of fact, from the very nature of our institutions, the
States cannot be kept in union by force. The majority, or
the most powerful portion, may conquer and reduce to subjection
the other; but when this is done, the States are not
in union, the constitutional connection is not restored. It is
but the spectacle of a conquered people submitting to superior
power; and no ties of affection, no cooperation in a common
government, no <em>American</em> Union can reasonably be hoped
between the conquerors and the conquered. Believe me, sir,
if ever the unhappy hour should arrive when American blood
is shed in a contest between the States&mdash;some desiring to
secede, and the others endeavoring to compel them by force
of arms to remain in the Union&mdash;whenever that hour comes,
our connection is immediately broken, to all beneficial purposes,
for the happiness or prosperity of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Mr. President, with regard to my own State. Should
this proviso be adopted, and should satisfaction not be given
in the other particulars which I have mentioned, will North
Carolina join in resisting, in any mode, the action of this
government? Will she unite in measures for secession, for
revolution, or for retaliatory legislation? I am so far, sir,
from undertaking to speak upon this subject for the South,
which I wish to be understood now and always as disavowing,
that I do not feel myself even empowered to speak what will
be the judgment and conduct of my own State. As was well
said the other day by my friend and colleague [Mr. Mangum],
in presenting some resolutions to the Senate, disunion
is a question which we cannot discuss here as one for Senatorial
action. We are sent here to represent the State under
the Constitution, and to discharge ordinary legislative and
executive duties, which presuppose the Constitution to be
entire and in full force. We of course have no delegated
authority to speak the views of North Carolina upon any such
question as that which I have just stated. Last year the
Legislature of my State passed a series of resolutions, in
which, after expressing in very strong and decided terms the
sense felt by the people of that State of the wrong of the
Wilmot Proviso, and other kindred measures, they nevertheless
adopted an extract from the Farewell Address of Washington,
embodying the sentiment that we were not to look
upon the Union as <em>in any event</em> to be abandoned. Making
all proper modifications of that large and most comprehensive
expression, "in any event," it could have no less interpretation
than this, that none of the events alluded to by the preceding
resolutions would furnish ground for the abandonment
of the Union. Since that time this matter has been
much discussed in North Carolina; primary meetings have
been held; different resolutions have been passed by those
meetings, some discountenancing and declining to be represented
in the Nashville Convention, others approving the call,
and resolving to send delegates; and one meeting, with a
somewhat singular inconsistency, while protesting against a
government of unlimited powers, solemnly pledged itself to
adhere to, abide by, and support whatever the Nashville Convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
shall determine. I hope, sir, that North Carolina
will not concur on account of the passage of the Wilmot
Proviso, in any measures for the dissolution of the Union or
resistance to the Government. My own opinion is that it
would furnish no sufficient ground for such a procedure. I
say that here; I shall say it at home when the proper time
arrives, if a time shall ever arrive when it shall be necessary
to say it. But this I say, also, that I shall feel, if such an
event as the adoption of the proviso should happen, that a
serious indignity has been offered to us; not, perhaps, designed&mdash;I
will not charge any with a deliberate design to
insult&mdash;but yet an indignity, because such must be the wanton
adoption of an objectionable and useless measure, after distinct
notice that it will be considered in that light. And
rely upon it, sir, that whatever may be the result in regard to
any external action of the people of the Southern States, if
something satisfactory is not done respecting fugitive slaves,
and if the application of this Wilmot Proviso is insisted upon,
there will be left in the hearts of our people a rankling sense
of injustice and offense. They will have less of hope in the
future operation of the Constitution. They will feel, to a
certain extent, a painful conviction that the large majority
of the inhabitants of the free States have not that sympathy
with their feelings and regard for their rights, that justice
and moderation in the exercise of the known powers, and
that abstinence from the needless exercise of doubtful and
questionable ones which are so essential to keep the mind of
the country united; and, unless our minds are united, the
forced association of reluctant communities, who stay together,
not to obtain good from their connection, but to avoid
evils of separation, does not deserve the name of Union.</p>

<p>Mr. President, I am sorry that I have occupied the Senate
so long. I will endeavor to draw the few remaining remarks
I have to make to a speedy close. I have submitted with
entire frankness the views which I entertain. I believe, conscientiously
believe, that there is in the Northern States of the
Union a sincere attachment to the Constitution, a firm adherence
to the compromises of the Constitution, and a just consideration
for the rights and feelings of their Southern brethren.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
And I have a strong hope, an abiding confidence, that
these sentiments will, on every proper occasion, be manifested
by the great body of inhabitants in the free States. If
I thought otherwise, I should be without hope, and should
be inclined to consider my birth an event to be deplored, as
imposing upon me the necessity of witnessing the utter destruction
of my country. But, sir, let a proper bill for the
recapture of fugitive slaves be passed, let this Wilmot Proviso
be dropped (and, if possible, sink into insignificancy and
oblivion), and I will be willing to deal with every question
before the Senate in the utmost liberality of compromise. Yes,
sir, I have no objections to compromise. The Union sprung out
of compromise. The Union is supported by legislative compromise,
a compromise incorporated in the fundamental law,
the Constitution. Springing out of compromise, this Union
can only be preserved and made to promote the great and
good ends designed by and hoped from it, by our carrying
on the government habitually in the spirit of compromise.
In that view, sir, I am willing to withdraw all objection to
the admission of California, with or without an alteration of
her limits as settled by her constitution. And when I say
that, Mr. President, permit me to say that I make a great
sacrifice. Sir, I occupy the same position with regard to
California now as I did at the last session. The honorable
Senator from Mississippi, now in his seat [Mr. Davis], knows
that I was with him upon a committee charged with the subject
of admitting those Territories as States. I announced
to him at once that I was totally and absolutely opposed to
their admission in any form, and with any subdivision of
territory. I have heard nothing to remove the objections I
then entertained; but, in the manner of the organization of
the government there, I find additional objections, strong in
themselves, and giving additional force to those which I had
before. And if I could believe that the views expressed by
the Senator from New York [Mr. Seward], the other day,
upon this subject, are the views entertained by the people of
California, or by the gentlemen who are sent here to represent
them, my objections would rise almost to an insurmountable
repugnance, to a perpetual opposition; for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Senator has not hesitated to tell us, in substance, that we have
no choice about admitting California; that she is a State, and
a State she will continue, irrespective of any act of Congress;
that she comes here and demands admission into this Union,
and, if not admitted here, our authority will be cast aside,
and she will be an independent republic upon the Pacific.
But, sir, I cannot believe, and do not believe, that such an
insolent dictation to us is designed by the people of California.
And I personally know the two gentlemen whom
she has selected as Senators, and am sure they would be the
first to disown and renounce the position assumed by their
patron upon this floor.</p>

<p>The honorable Senator from New York [Mr. Seward],
seems to consider the admission of California as a matter
beyond all price and all value, to be attained at every hazard
and every sacrifice, and therefore, notwithstanding the opinion
he has expressed with regard to slavery, though he considers
it a high, hospitable duty to entertain the fugitive slaves from
the South, and to keep them from their masters, though he
has a holy horror of the extension of slavery into the Territories
now free, and considers every obligation imposed by
the Constitution in reference to slavery overborne and annulled
by the supreme law of God&mdash;he tells us, that so all-important
is the admission of California, under the circumstances,
that he would have voted for her admission with an
express recognition by her constitution of the right to carry
slaves into her territory. An allusion to this subject seems
to have a strange effect upon the Senator from New York.
He is carried back at once to the last session, when certain
measures were pending here for the purpose of organizing
some temporary government for California and New Mexico;
and alluding to the gentleman who is now the source of power
and patronage in this Government, he thus expresses himself:</p>

<p>"May this republic never have a President commit a more
serious or more dangerous usurpation of power than the act
of the present eminent Chief Magistrate, in endeavoring to
induce the legislative authorities to relieve him from the exercise
of military power, by establishing civil institutions, regulated
by law, in a distant province. Rome would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
standing this day if she had had such generals and such tribunes."</p>

<p>Yes, sir, if Rome had been blessed with a Zachary Taylor
for commander of her armies; if Rome had been blessed with
a Zachary Taylor for a tribune, the Goths, the Vandals, and
the Huns, Attila, and all his hordes, would have poured upon
the empire in vain&mdash;they would have been repelled, overcome
upon the embattled plain, and driven back to their
fastnesses in the North, and Rome would stand this day proud
mistress of the world! Now, sir, whether the President of
the United States can swallow such an adulation as this, I
will not undertake to decide; but such is my estimate of his
intelligence and his merit, of his modesty&mdash;a just modesty,
which usually accompanies true merit&mdash;that I believe he has
no powers of deglutition sufficient to get it down.</p>

<p>I have said, Mr. President, that I should make a great
sacrifice in my vote for the admission of California; yet I will
make the sacrifice, not grudgingly, but cheerfully; and, as
said by the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Cass], the other day,
if asked "What would I do to restore harmony to the country,
and make this still a united and happy people," I would
answer like him, "I scarcely know what I would <em>not</em> do to
accomplish such an end."</p>

<p>Mr. President, I feel the importance of this great subject,
and my utter want of power to treat it as it deserves. I wish
to excite or to irritate the angry feelings of no section of this
country; I am conscious, in my own bosom, of no sentiment
towards any portion of my countrymen, except one of
respect and cordial attachment. But I may be permitted to
except from this general declaration those mischievous associations
in the Northern part of the United States, which, to
our injury, and to the great and permanent injury of the
unfortunate slaves among us, have been, with an unholy pertinacity,
agitating the subject of this domestic institution of
ours for the last fifteen years. Towards them, even, I trust
I have no feeling of hatred. For every portion of the
American people, I care not whether in the East or West,
the North or South, I have the heart and hand of a brother.
There is no gentleman upon this floor, among my immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
associates around me, no gentleman upon the other side of
the chamber, for whom I have not always manifested a proper
personal consideration and kindness; but I wish to make our
Northern friends aware of the danger to which we are
exposed. My own views have never been extreme, my position
has ever been moderate; and I trust some credit will be given
me when I declare my deliberate judgment, that consequences
the most serious, even the most calamitous, may follow a particular
disposition of this subject by the present Congress.
If it should be believed throughout the Southern country that
sentiments which we have heard here uttered, are the sentiments
of the whole body of the North, every desire to
remain together would sink in Southern hearts. We would
be together, then, not for love or affection, not from the hope
of happiness or improvement; and if we would remain united
at all, it would be solely from dread of the greater and darker
calamities that might follow our separation. If this subject
is met in a proper spirit, it can be easily settled and adjusted.
So far as I am concerned, I am willing to meet upon any
reasonable ground. I am willing to yield much that I wish,
to do much for which I have a strong and serious repugnance.</p>

<p>I call upon every conservative gentleman in this body,
every one from a free State who desires to perpetuate the
institutions of his country in their true spirit and character,
who wishes not to convert our Union into an association of
discordant and discontented parts, held together by dread or
force, but to preserve us one people, united in heart and affection,
I call upon him to meet us upon the ground of kindness,
compromise, and conciliation. I say to him, drop this odious
proviso, a measure powerful for evil and impotent for good;
let it not have an immortality of mischief; give us security
for the restoration of our fugitive slaves; admit California
as you wish, and if you choose to abolish in the District of
Columbia this foreign slave-trade, this conversion of the seat
of government into a general mart for the slavedealers of the
surrounding States, I say abolish it. My colleague [Mr.
Mangum] and myself both stand ready to vote for it. Permit
me, sir, to say to our Northern friends, that if they suppose
Southern gentlemen to be wedded to any of the adventitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
evils or abuses of slavery, to be unwilling to correct
excesses, or disposed to support cruelty or to patronize inhumanity,
they do us great injustice. Upon the rights of
property we stand&mdash;these we consider sacred&mdash;and from our
support of them we cannot be moved. But, saving these,
make what regulations of police the occasion may require,
and I will not only submit, but will give them my hearty
concurrence and approbation.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it cannot be&mdash;I will not believe it&mdash;nothing
but demonstration, nothing but the accomplished fact shall
satisfy me, that we have so degenerated from our sires of the
Revolution as not to be able harmoniously to adjust the questions
before us. It cannot be that the true spirit of concession
and compromise has fled; that idealisms have taken the
place of constitutional obligations and kindly feelings; that
fanaticism has dethroned reason, and the Union, the work
of our noble fathers, just as it has well commenced its onward
progress to a future of real glory and power, is to be broken
to pieces by the rude hands of agitation, by cabals abroad or
intrigues at home, contrary to the general sentiment and earnest
wish of the great mass of the people. Sir, we have had
offerings made here for the preservation of this Union from
every quarter of this chamber. Often and nobly have they
been made by the distinguished Senator from Michigan [Mr.
Cass]; firm, steady, constant, and true in this cause has my
friend from New York, on the other side of the chamber
[Mr. Dickinson], at all times been. The distinguished Senator
from Kentucky [Mr. Clay], in his late earnest and
patriotic efforts, has added another laurel to the immortal
chaplet that binds his brow; and but a few days since, the
great expounder of the Constitution [Mr. Webster], that
man of mighty mental and moral power, closed the list of
great names engaged in this holy cause, in a speech so clear
in expression, so comprehensive in patriotism, so noble in
self-devotion, that could we doubt the success of these united
efforts for harmony and conciliation, we must needs believe
that, for some inexpiable crime, God has visited us with
judicial blindness, preparatory to the outpouring of his indignation
upon our country. Sir, I will not believe this, I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
not, I will not despair of a cause so good. On the contrary
I trust that we shall yet come together on a common basis of
harmonious cooperation, and find ourselves able to adopt, as
the expression not only of a patriotic wish, but of an assured
and confident hope, the sentiment made immortal by the
great Senator from Massachusetts, "<em>Liberty and Union, now
and forever, one and inseparable</em>."</p>

<p>That great range of mountains, extending from the St.
Lawrence to the plains of Alabama, called by De Soto Appalachian,
and by the Indian tribes, Alleghanies, which, in their
tongue, signifies the endless, attains its greatest elevation in
the Black Mountain group in the western part of this State.</p>

<p>This group lies partly within the counties of Yancey,
McDowell and Buncombe; and the tallest peak of the cluster,
and of all the peaks east of the Rocky Mountains, is Mt.
Mitchell. From its dominating summit there is thrown off a
ridge which runs west, south and southwest, in a zigzag shape,
alternated with deep gaps, tall summits and frightful precipices,
until it melts away in the peninsula of the plain which
is enclosed by the waters of the Swannanoa and the French
Broad, in the county of Buncombe.</p>

<p>In this range, about seven miles from where these waters
meet, there is a little gorge-like valley scooped out of its
western slope, which spreads its narrow bosom precisely in
the face of the setting sun. The tall dome of Mt. Mitchell
literally casts its shadow over this mountain-cradled vale as
the sun first comes up from the eastern sea. Great ridges
hem it in on either side, gradually melting on the south into
the sloping hills on which stands the town of Asheville. A
bold fresh brook from springs high up in the heart of the
mountain ripples through the bottom of this vale, reenforced
by a hundred smaller streams pouring from the ravines on
the right and left, and empties its bright, fresh floods into the
French Broad five miles below the county-seat. Near the
very head of this valley is a charming little homestead, consisting
of fertile bits of meadow on the brook-side, above
which are open fields swelling upwards to the skirts of the
mountain forests. In the midst of these fields, where the
ground slopes gently towards the brook, there stood, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the beginning of this century, an old-fashioned log-house of
the kind familiarly known to our mountain people as a
"double-cabin." An orchard of a growth and fruitful luxuriance
peculiar to that region surrounded the house and
curtilage, imparting that air of rustic beauty and abundance
which constitutes a special charm in simple country homes.</p>

<p>This spot, at the period indicated, was the home of an honest,
upright, and intelligent man, whose name was George
Swain; and here, on the 4th day of January, 1801, was born
the child who became the man to whose memory we desire
to do honor this day.</p>

<p>David Lowrie Swain was the second son and child of
George and Caroline Swain. His father was of English descent,
and was born in Roxboro, Massachusetts, in 1763. He
came South and settled in Wilkes, now Oglethorpe county,
in Georgia, served in the Legislature of that State five years,
and was a member of the convention that revised the Constitution
of Georgia. His health failing, he removed to Buncombe
county, North Carolina, in 1795, and was one of its
earliest settlers. He was for many years Postmaster at Asheville,
and until within two years of his death; becoming insane
a year or two previous to that event. Soon after his
settlement in Buncombe he was married to Caroline Lowrie,
a widow, whose maiden name was Lane, a sister of Joel
Lane, the founder of the city of Raleigh, and of Jesse Lane,
the father of General Joe Lane, late United States Senator
from Oregon, and Democratic candidate for Vice-President
on the ticket with General Breckinridge in 1860. This lady
had three children by her first husband, one of whom, the
late Colonel James Lowrie, of Buncombe county, lived and
died a citizen of most excellent repute. By her last husband
she had seven children. All of these are now dead.</p>

<p>George Swain was by trade a hatter, but like all the thrifty
men of his day, he combined farming with his shop, and was
a successful man in both, as success was then measured.
Whilst his hats were famous all the county over, his little
farm on Beaver Dam, the name of the stream on which it
was located, was considered a pattern in that period of rude
agriculture. His apple-trees, under the shade of which young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
David was born and reared, were the product of cuttings
brought all the way from Massachusetts&mdash;a great and tedious
journey then&mdash;and some of the varieties which he thus imported
still remain in that region by the names which he
gave them.</p>

<p>He was a man of some learning and much intelligence,
mixed with a considerable degree of eccentricity. Like all
New Englanders, he believed much in education, and struggled
constantly to impart it to his children. He was possessed
of a most wonderful memory, and I have heard it said
by a lady who, as a girl, was intimate in his house, that he
often entertained her and other visitors for hours together
with the recitation of poems without book or manuscript.</p>

<p>In this humble but instructive home, secluded from anything
that could be termed fashionable society, but trained
to industry, and instructed in the ways of integrity, young
David Swain's early youth was passed. I cannot subscribe
to the phrase so usually employed in describing such biographical
beginnings as this, when it is said that the subject
of the memoir was "without the advantages of birth." The
fact that a child is born amid such surroundings, and with
such blood in his veins as coursed through those of young
Swain, constitutes the very highest advantages which could
surround the birth and bringing up of a young man who is
to fight his way in a country like ours.</p>

<p>The surest elements of success are commonly found in the
absence of indulgences in youth, and the most successful warriors
against fate are those who are taught by stern necessity
to fight early.</p>

<p>Governor Swain was fond of recurring to the scenes and
influences of his early life, and always felt that he had been
fortunate in possessing a father to whom he could look with
respect and confidence. He maintained a close and confidential
correspondence with him from the time he left his
roof to make his own way, and often referred to it as having
had a most beneficial influence upon him.</p>

<p>In the summer vacation of 1852 he visited Buncombe, and
I accompanied him out to Beaver Dam to see once more the
place of his birth, then and now in the possession of the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Thomas Stradly. On a spot not very far from the house he
stopped and told me that near this place was the first time
he ever saw a wagon. This wondrous vehicle, he said, belonged
to Zebulon and Bedent Baird, Scotchmen by birth,
who came to North Carolina some time previous to 1790, by
way of New Jersey. There being no road for such vehicles,
this wagon had approached the house of Mr. George Swain,
he said, in the washed-out channel of the creek, and the
future Governor of North Carolina stood in the orchard
waiting its approach with wonder and awe, and finally, as its
thunder reverberated in his ears, as it rolled over the rocky
channel of the creek, he incontinently took to his heels, and
only rallied when safely entrenched behind his father's house.
He enjoyed the relation of this to me exquisitely. As a
palliation of his childish ignorance, however, he added that
this was the first wagon which had crossed the Blue Ridge.</p>

<p>With healthful labor at home, and healthful instruction
by the fireside, the days of his early childhood passed, till he
attained the age at which his careful father thought he should
be placed under other instructors. At the age of fifteen he
was accordingly sent to the school near Asheville, called the
Newton Academy. Its founder and first teacher was the
Rev. George Newton, a Presbyterian clergyman of good
repute, who was succeeded by Rev. Mr. Porter, another Presbyterian
clergyman, and then by the late William Smith, of
Georgia, familiarly known as "<em>Long Billy</em>." This academy
was justly famous in that region, and educated, in whole or
in part, many of the prominent citizens of that country beyond
the Blue Ridge, and elsewhere. Governor B. F. Perry
and Hon. Waddy Thompson, of South Carolina, M. Patton,
R. B. Vance, James W. Patton, James Erwin, and many
others of North Carolina, were classmates of young Swain
at that school. A lady who is now living, and was also a
schoolmate of his there, tells me he was a most exemplary
boy and diligent student, soon and clearly outstripping all his
associates in the acquisition of knowledge. This superiority
was doubtless due to the aid of an exceedingly strong and
tenacious memory which he inherited from his father, and
which characterized him through life. Mr. M. Patton informs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
me that young Swain taught Latin in the same school
for several months.</p>

<p>I am not aware that he attended any other school till he
came to the University in 1821; in that year he entered the
junior class, but only remained some four months. Want of
means most probably prevented him from graduating. In
1822 he entered upon the study of the law in the office of
Chief Justice Taylor, in Raleigh. He obtained license to
practise in December, 1822; and referring to that event in
his address at the opening of Tucker Hall, August, 1867,
forty-five years afterwards, he gives a most entertaining picture
of the Supreme Court which granted his license, and
of the great North Carolina lawyers who at that time were
practicing before its bar.</p>

<p>Returning to the mountains, with his license in his pocket
and a sweetheart in his eye, he went hopefully to work, and
became almost immediately in possession of a lucrative practice.
The good people of his native county were quick to
perceive his talents and integrity, and in 1824 he was elected
a member of the House of Commons from Buncombe. So
great was the satisfaction which his conduct in that capacity
gave to his constituents, that they continued him as their
member by successive elections until 1829.</p>

<p>In his character as legislator he was most distinguished for
his industry and attention to details, especially in the department
of statistics and taxation, in which he soon became the
highest authority in the body of which he was a member.
He was prominent in getting the bill passed for the building
of the French Broad Turnpike, a measure which revolutionized
the intercourse between Tennessee, Kentucky, and South
Carolina, bringing an immense stream of emigration, travel,
and trade through western North Carolina, and adding greatly
to his own popularity among the people of that region.</p>

<p>In 1829 he was elected, by the Legislature, Solicitor of the
Edenton Circuit, a circumstance remarkable in our legal
annals, both on account of his extreme youth at the time of
his election to so important an office, and because the Edenton
Circuit was in the most distant part of the State from his
residence, and it had been the custom to select for that office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
a lawyer residing in the district for which he was elected.
This compliment to his learning and ability was conferred
upon him without solicitation, under the following circumstances:
A bitter contest had sprung up between two candidates
for that position, one of whom was the notorious Robert
Potter, and the friends of neither consenting to give way, by
common consent both sides agreed to take young Swain.</p>

<p>He rode only one circuit, when the next Legislature
elected him a Judge of the Superior Court over Judge
Seawell, then an able and eminent practitioner at the Raleigh
bar. Swain was at that time the youngest man ever elevated
to the bench in this State, except Judge Badger, who was
elected at the age of twenty-six. He had ridden four circuits
as judge with great acceptance, when in 1832 he was
elected by the Legislature to be Governor of the State over
several competitors, and was inaugurated on the first day of
January, 1832. Under the Constitution of 1776 the term
of Governor was only one year, and Governor Swain was
reelected in 1833 and 1834 successively. Just previous to
the close of his official term in 1835 he was elected President
of the State University, under the following circumstances:
It is said that he would have continued in politics if the way
had then been clear for him to go to the United States Senate;
or that he would have continued in the law, could he
then have returned to the bench. But the way to neither
being at that time open to him, he had no desire to return to
the practice of law, or to continue further in State politics,
in which he had already attained the highest honors which
his State had to bestow. Under these circumstances, he
turned his eyes towards the presidency of the University,
vacant since January, 1835, by the death of the venerable
and lamented Dr. Joseph Caldwell. But great as was his
reputation as lawyer and politician, his character as a scholar
was by no means so established, nor had public attention been
directed to him as a fit person to take charge of an institution
of learning. He one day called his friend, Judge Nash, into
the executive office and told him frankly that he desired to
be made President of the University; and seeing that the
Judge did not express much approbation of the project, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
asked him to consult with Judge Cameron, and if they two
did not approve of it, he would abandon the idea. Nash
promised to do so, and on meeting Judge Cameron gave him
his opinion that Swain would not do for the place. Cameron,
however, dissented at once, saying that Swain was the very
man; that though it was true he was not a scholar, yet he
had all the other necessary elements of success; and that the
man who had shown he knew so well how to manage men
could not fail to know how to manage boys. So, at the next
meeting of the Board of Trustees, Judge Cameron nominated
him and secured his election to the Presidency. This closed
his political and judicial career.</p>

<p>I have omitted to mention, however, in its chronological
order, a most important part of that career. In 1835, whilst
Governor, he was elected a delegate from the county of Buncombe
to the convention of that year which amended the
Constitution. Perhaps no portion of his political service was
of greater importance to the State than that which he rendered
as a member of that convention. His sagacity, liberality,
and profound acquaintance with the statistics of the
State, and with the history of the constitutional principles of
government contributed very largely to the formation of that
admirable instrument, the Constitution of 1835, a more excellent
one than which, our surroundings considered, was never
framed by any English-speaking people. Few men in our
annals have risen in life more rapidly than he, or sooner
attained the highest honors in every branch of the government,
legislative, judicial and executive. In making an estimate
of his character and capacity in these offices, we shall
be compelled, beyond doubt, to conclude that it required very
substantial abilities to enable him thus to reach and sustain
himself creditably in them all.</p>

<p>His practice as a lawyer was a very lucrative one to have
been acquired at so early an age. As an evidence of the
esteem in which his abilities and learning were held, he was,
at the age of twenty-seven, when he had been a lawyer but
four years, retained as counsel for the State of North Carolina,
with George E. Badger, in a most complicated mass of
litigation, involving the title to more land than was ever sued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
for under one title in our State (except, perhaps, that instituted
by the heirs of Lord Granville in 1804). Several
hundred thousand acres of land had been granted to William
Cathcart, Huldeman, and Elseman, citizens of Pennsylvania,
lying in the counties of Burke, Buncombe, Haywood, and
Macon. Subsequently, these same lands, in great part, were
sold in smaller lots to settler citizens by the State, under the
belief that when patented originally by Cathcart and others
they were not subject to entry, for the reason that they were
within the boundaries which had been reserved to the Indians
by various treaties. One hundred suits in ejectment were
brought against these settlers in the Circuit Court of the
United States by the heirs of Cathcart. All these actions
were dependent on similar facts, and each one involved the
validity, accuracy, and definite character of various surveys
made at sundry different times during a period of nearly half a
century previous thereto, under treaties between the State and
the Cherokee Indians, and between the United States and
the same Indian tribe. The State resolved to defend the
titles it had given to its citizens, and employed Badger and
Swain to contend with Mr. Gaston, who was for the plaintiffs&mdash;a
very high compliment to both of them. Here was
a field wherein Governor Swain had no superior, and where
his peculiar talents came specially into play. A complicated
maze of long-forgotten facts was to be resurrected from buried
documents, dimly traced surveyors' lines and corners through
hundreds of miles of tangled mountain forests were to be
established, partly by the evidence of old grey-haired woodmen
and partly by the fading outlines of the rude maps and
indistinct field-notes of the surveyors of that day; and old
treaties and musty statutes were to be brought out of the dust
and made to speak in behalf of the rights of our people. In
such a work his soul delighted, and to his faithful labors and
indefatigable energy must the final success of the State be
mainly attributed. For though he was put on the bench, and
from the bench was made Governor before the test case was
tried in 1832, and the victory won, he never ceased his labors
in this behalf, and his official letter-book of that period is
filled with evidences of his zeal and research. Judge Badger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
who was as generous as he was great, and who followed the
case up to the Supreme Court of the United States, where
he was assisted by Mr. Webster, frankly acknowledged that
the cause was won mainly by the careful preparation of
Swain. Another circumstance connected with this litigation,
worth the mention in these days is, that notwithstanding the
vast amount of valuable work he had done already, yet because
the cases were not concluded when he was made a judge,
Governor Swain voluntarily returned half of his retainer into
the treasury. All of which goes to show that in selecting
him out of so many able and older lawyers to assist Mr.
Badger, the State had chosen wisely indeed.</p>

<p>There were giants in those days, and the giants were honest!</p>

<p>During his service in the Legislature no great or exciting
issues were before the people, and his career there displays
no extraordinary effort in any direction. He soon acquired,
however, a high reputation for learning and industry in dealing
with the practical questions of the day, among which
then was the very vexed one of the ratio of representation in
the Legislature between the East, where were many slaves,
and the West, where there were few. This finally forced
the calling of the Convention in 1835. It was, however, an
era of great political importance, viewed in the light of subsequent
events. The great political parties&mdash;Whig and Democratic&mdash;which
have shaped the destinies of these United
States for full half a century, were then crystallizing from the
confused and crude opinions of our early American politics.
All thinking men began about this period to range themselves
with one or the other of the schools which undertook to construe
the Constitution of the United States, to ascertain its
meaning and its powers, and to define its relations with the
States. A gigantic, and, as it would seem, an endless task
indeed. Swain sided with Adams, Clay, and Webster, whose
followers began to be called Whigs. Of the prominent men
of that day, who agreed with him, or with whom he agreed,
were Gaston, Morehead, Badger, Mangum, Cherry, Graham,
Stanly, Moore, Miller, Outlaw, and Rayner. Of those who adhered
to the school of Jefferson and Calhoun, were the venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Macon, Ruffin, Haywood, Saunders, Branch, Edwards,
Seawell, Shepherd, Donnell, Fisher, Craige, and Venable.
It is not practicable to enumerate all the mighty men of that
day who controlled our affairs and gave tone and character
to our society. No State in the Union had a larger list of
very able citizens, and we can pay no higher compliment to
Governor Swain than to say that he rose up among such, and
was the peer of them all.</p>

<p>As before stated, he rode but four circuits as judge. From
all his decisions during that time there came up but eighteen
appeals. Of these, thirteen were sustained by the Supreme
Court, consisting of Ruffin, Henderson, and Hall, and in one
other he was sustained by the dissenting opinion of Chief
Justice Ruffin, leaving but four in which he was unanimously
overruled. This, says Mr. Moore, who is now our highest
living authority in matters relating to the law, is an evidence
of judicial ability more satisfactory than could elsewhere have
been furnished among our judges, and no higher compliment
could have been paid him. Mr. Moore also informs me that
Swain was very popular as a judge, even in those days when
the only road to popularity in that office was the honest and
able discharge of its exalted duties. In the contest for judge,
when he was elected over Seawell, he first acquired a nickname
which stuck to him till after he retired from politics.
Repeated attempts with various candidates had been
made to defeat Seawell, who was obnoxious to the party to
which Swain belonged, but all these efforts had failed until
Swain's name was brought forward. "Then," said an enthusiastic
member from Iredell, "we took up old '<em>warping
bars</em>' from Buncombe, and warped him out." After the
Governor became President of the University he lost this
humorous and not ill-fitting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</i>, and acquired from the
college wits the geographical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">descriptio personae</i>, "Old
Bunk," which adhered to him through life.</p>

<p>The official letter-book of Governor Swain during his
administration shows that his time and labors were principally
devoted to the questions of constitutional reform; the coast
defenses of North Carolina; the claims of the State against
the general government; the removal and settlement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Cherokee Indians, the adjustment of land titles in the West,
and other matters of domestic concern.</p>

<p>During this time, however, many letters of literary and
historic importance were written by him. There is found
on those pages a letter written by Mr. John C. Hamilton, of
New York, son of Alexander Hamilton, propounding eleven
inquiries relating to the history of North Carolina; more
particularly with regard to the system of her colonial and
early State taxation; and the reasons of the action of her
convention in regard to the adoption of the Federal Constitution,
and kindred topics. Governor Swain's replies to these
queries show a wonderful amount of information and research
into the minuter sources of our early history, clearly indicating
that he was possessed in a high degree of those peculiar
talents which constitute the true historian. Most of his literary
labor throughout his life was in this department, and his
collections were especially rich in the early history of North
Carolina. Who is there left now in our State able to use the
material for its history which he had been accumulating
through so many years? To this great work he had intended
to devote the closing years of his life. What stores of information
perished with him! He was the special vindicator
of that much-abused and much-misunderstood class of men,
the Regulators of our colonial times. No man in the State
has done so much to clear their fame&mdash;few have been so competent.
The papers contributed by him to the <cite>University
Magazine</cite> on the subject would form a volume, if collected,
and their great value is indicated by the numerous inquiries
instituted for them by men in various States of the Union.
His lecture before the Historical Society in 1852 may be said
to have settled the question of the merits of the Regulators
and their service to liberty.</p>

<p>As Governor of the State, in 1833, he laid the cornerstone
of the present capitol amid imposing ceremonies; a
building designed with perhaps as pure and simple taste as
any in America, and as solid and enduring as any in the
world.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January, 1826, he was married to Miss
Eleanor H. White, daughter of William White, Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of State, and granddaughter of Governor Caswell, a union
productive of great domestic happiness to a man so fitted as
he, by nature and by a life of unsullied purity, to appreciate
the ties of home and the love of wife and children. By this
lady there were born to him several children, of whom but
three, two daughters and a son, ever reached maturity. His
oldest son, David, who died in childhood, was a boy of great
promise. His eldest child and daughter, Anne, died unmarried
in 1867. The second daughter, and now only surviving
child, Eleanor Hope, married General S. D. Atkins, of Freeport,
Illinois, where she now resides. The son, Richard
Caswell, was killed a few years since, near his home in Illinois,
being crushed to death by falling between two railroad
cars while in motion. There is now no male representative
of the name surviving.</p>

<p>From the time that Governor Swain entered upon his
duties as President of the University his career is marked by
few notable events of which his biographer can make mention.
Although the work he did here was undoubtedly the
great work of his life, it is impossible for us to compute it.
As with the silent forces of nature, which we know to be
the greatest that are exerted in this world, but which yet
elude the grasp of our senses, so is it impossible for us to
measure the power of the able and faithful teacher. The
connections between moral cause and effect are much more
difficult to trace than those between physical cause and effect,
but although in either case the lines are dim the wise do not
fail to see that they are there, and that the results are powerful.
It is conceded that the imperceptible and benign force
of light and heat which lifts the mighty oak out of the earth,
and spreads its branches to the skies, is infinitely greater than
that of the noisy whirlwind which prostrates it in the dust.</p>

<p>Says Mr. Herbert Spencer: "In every series of dependent
changes a small initial difference often works a marked difference
in the results. The mode in which a particular breaker
bursts on the beach may determine whether the seed of some
foreign plant which it bears is or is not stranded, may cause
the presence or absence of this plant from the flora of the
land, and may so affect for millions of years, in countless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
ways, the living creatures throughout the earth. The whole
tenor of a life may be changed by a single word of advice,
or a glance may determine an action which alters thoughts,
feelings, and deeds throughout a long series of years."</p>

<p>We know that the moral tone of a community is the mainspring
of its glory or its shame; that that tone is to a great
extent imparted by its educated men; we know, too, that no
man has ever lived in North Carolina whose opportunities for
thus influencing those who control her destinies have been
greater than Governor Swain's were; and I am quite sure
that no man ever more diligently and earnestly improved
those opportunities. There is this, too, further and better to
be said, that in the whole course of his contact with the young
men of North Carolina and of the South at the University
for a third of a century, the whole weight of every particle
of influence which he possessed was exerted in behalf of good
morals, good government, patriotism, and religion. The
sparks of good which he elicited, the trains of generous ambition
which he set on fire, the number of young lives which
his teachings have directed into the paths of virtue and knowledge,
and colored with the hues of heaven&mdash;who but God
shall tell? If we could see events and analyze destinies as
only the Most High can, how wondrous would appear the
harvest of David L. Swain's sowing! How many great
thoughts worked out in the still watches of the night; how
many noble orations in the forum, stirring the hearts of men;
how many eloquent and momentous discourses in the pulpit;
how many bold strokes of patriotic statesmanship; how many
daring deeds and sublime deaths on bloody fields of battle;
how many good and generous and honest things done in
secret; how many evil things and sore temptations resisted;
in short, how much of that which constitutes the public and
private virtue of our people, the prosperity, the honor, and
the glory of our State might not be traced to the initial inspiration
of David L. Swain! Say what you will for the
mighty things done by the mighty ones of earth, but here
is the truest honor and renown. For whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall
cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
he that helps to shape an immortal soul, and fit it for the
service of heaven and humanity, verily his memory shall
endure until that which is perfect is come!</p>

<p>How well do I remember the many occasions during my
sojourn at the University, when he as my preceptor, esteeming
such influences of greater importance to the class than
the texts of the lessons, would for the time give his whole
soul to the stirring up of these generous and emulous sentiments
in the hearts of his pupils. The very first recitation
in which I ever appeared before him was one such. I shall
never forget it. In 1851 I entered the University, and
joined the senior class as an irregular. The first lesson was
in constitutional law. A single general question was asked
and answered as to the subject in hand, and then he began
to discourse of Chancellor Kent, whose treatise we were studying;
from Kent he went to Story, from Story to Marshall,
repeating anecdotes of the great Americans who had framed
and interpreted our organic law, and touching upon the
debate between Hayne and Webster. From these, he went
back and back to the men and the times when the great seminal
principles of Anglo-Saxon liberty were eliminated from
feudal chaos, and placed one by one as stones, polished by
the genius of the wise, and cemented by the blood of the
brave, in the walls of the temple of human freedom. He
told us of the eloquence of Burke, of the genius of Chatham;
he took us into the prison of Eliot and went with us to the
death-bed of Hampden; into the closet with Coke and Sergeant
Maynard; and to the forum, where Somers spoke; to
the deck of the <i>Brill</i>, where William, the deliverer, stood as
he gazed upon the shores of England; to the scaffolds of Sidney
and of our own glorious Raleigh. Warming as he went
with the glowing theme, walking up and down the recitation-room,
which was then the library of the "old South," with
long and awkward strides, heaving those heavy passionate
sighs, which were always with him the witnesses of deep
emotion, he would now and then stop, take down from its
shelf a volume of some old poet, and read with trembling
voice some grand and glowing words addressed to man's truest
ambition, that thrilled our souls like a song of the chief musician.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
A profound silence was evidence of the deep attention
of the class, and the hour passed almost before we knew it
had begun.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that this lecture was intended for my
benefit, as I was a stranger to the class and had entered it
under some disadvantages, and in his kindness of heart he
supposed I needed some encouragement. But such were
frequently given us. Nor were these digressions from the
chief business of the hour always of a serious nature. The
gayest wit and brightest humor often illumined the moments
when, not content with putting forth his own conceits, he
exerted himself to draw forth those of the class, and if he
succeeded sometimes in bringing forth a repartee that struck
<em>pat</em> upon his own head, no one enjoyed it more than himself.
Like a true humorist and story-teller, he enjoyed the taking
as well as the giving with the utmost good fellowship.</p>

<p>From the day that Governor Swain became the chief officer
of the University his life was literally devoted to its interests.
The same traits of character which had hitherto secured his
success in life were especially needed here. His prudence,
his cautious far-reaching policy, his constructive ability, his
insight into character, and remarkable faculty for suggesting
valuable work to others and setting them at it, his forbearance,
charity, self-control&mdash;these were all brought into play
with marked results. The reputation of the institution, and
the number of its students steadily and continually increased.
In 1835 there were not over ninety in attendance. In 1860
there were nearly five hundred.</p>

<p>Governor Swain was eminently a progressive man. He
loved to suggest, and to see his suggestions taken up and carried
out. What a number of improvements the record of
his management shows that he inaugurated at the University!
The excellent system of street-draining in the village of Chapel
Hill, by stone culverts, the planting of elms, the enclosing of
the college grounds, and their improvement and ornamentation
with shrubbery&mdash;all these were planned by him, and
executed under Dr. Mitchell's superintendence. He first
employed a college gardener. He was the founder of the
State Historical Society. He established, and assisted largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to support, the <cite>University Magazine</cite>, and was himself one of
its most regular and valued contributors. He was one of the
foremost friends of the North Carolina Central Railroad, and
offered to be one of a number to take the whole stock at once.
He first introduced the study of the Bible into college, and of
constitutional and international law. He was always deeply
interested in the prosperity of the village of Chapel Hill, believing,
and justly, that its welfare was identical with that of
the college. Circumstances since his death have amply
proved the truth of this. He had ever a kind word, and a
charitable estimate for every man, woman, and child in the
place.</p>

<p>Thirty-three years of his best days and the sincerest labors
of his existence were spent at our University in the training
of young men. As yet no monument has been erected in
its grounds to commemorate his virtues and his labors. The
valley of humiliation&mdash;nay, of the shadow of death&mdash;through
which our beloved institution has passed, in which she was
despoiled of everything but her glorious memories, and, I
trust, her gratitude, is the apology which can be offered for
this seeming, but not real, neglect. A simple tablet to his
memory might well be inserted in any of its walls, and fitly
written thereon might be the words found in the epitaph of
Sir Christopher Wren in the crypt of St. Paul's:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lector, si monumentum requiris,<br />
Circumspice!</i></p>

<p>In very truth the University may be looked upon as his
monument. It emerged from swaddling clothes under President
Caldwell; it passed through a vigorous youth into a
splendid manhood under President Swain. But whilst the
stranger stands upon the earth and beholds the monument of
the great architect in the magnificent pile whose tall fane
overtops the loftiest domes and spires of the greatest city in
the world, he who would fully comprehend the great work
of David Swain's life would have to stand upon the battlements
of heaven and survey the moral world with an angel's
ken.</p>

<p>I know of no man of his day, surrounded by so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
inducements to return to the paths leading to highest distinction
in active public life, who so completely put them all
away, and adhered so strictly to his accepted work. As we
have seen, his career as a politician and a lawyer had been
remarkably successful while he was yet at a very early age,
and if he had desired further honors he had all the qualities
which are supposed to fit men for the attainment of these
objects. Had he been possessed of a passion to accumulate
wealth, almost any other course in life would have fed this
desire more than the presidency of the University. From
all these fields of distinction and of wealth, the public sentiment
of his time desired that the officers, and especially the
chief officers, of the University should be isolated. This
expectation Governor Swain filled, and more than filled.
For the good of the institution, he not only laid aside whatever
of ambition he may have had in the directions usually
chosen by able men, but he subordinated many cherished
convictions, and refrained from doing many things which
he, no doubt, most ardently desired to do. In the nature
of things, this course, so essential to the success of an institution
entirely dependent on popular favor, begot many misconceptions
of his character. It has been said that he was
undecided in his opinions, and timid in the expression and
maintenance of them. I believe such an impression does his
memory great injustice. His nature was essentially gentle,
his manners mild, his temper was cautious; but I cannot
believe that he was either timid or undecided. I had the
honor&mdash;and I consider it both an honor and a happy fortune&mdash;to
be on terms of confidential intimacy with him from
my first entrance into the University until his death. We
were in the utmost accord on all questions pertaining to
church and state, and during my subsequent career, especially
in those troublous years of war, I consulted him more frequently
perhaps than any other man in the State, except
Governor Graham. So affectionately was his interest in my
welfare always manifested that, many people supposed we
were relatives, and I have frequently been asked if such were
not the fact.</p>

<p>This state of our relations gave me ample opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
know him well, and I believe I can say with entire truth
that whilst his course of life and surroundings necessarily
made him tolerant and even liberal towards those who disagreed
with him, he was as positive in his opinions, religious
and political, and as firm in his adherence to them, as any man
of my acquaintance. The unpopularity of which he was
afraid, and which produced that cautious habit which some
men mistook for timidity, pertained to the institution which
he had in charge, and not to himself. And as the State
reaped the benefit of his prudence in the increased prosperity
of the University, the injustice of charging this to a defect
of character becomes all the more apparent.</p>

<p>The remarkable character of his memory served him in
good stead in many ways through life. As a lawyer it had
been invaluable, not only enabling him to cite cases with
great readiness to the court, but in trials before juries, without
taking notes, he could repeat the testimony of all the witnesses
examined, no matter how many, nor how long the
trial continued.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was more thoroughly versed in biography than
any man who has ever lived in America; certainly North
Carolina never produced his equal in this respect. His wonderful
memory, combined with great industry, was stimulated
by a genuine love of genealogical studies. Almost the first
question he would ask a student on meeting him, if indeed
he did not already know, was, "Who is your father?" On
being told, by a few quick questions he would possess himself
of the boy's lineage, and would never forget it. Generally,
however, the boys would be utterly astounded on presenting
themselves, to find that the Governor knew more of them
and their families than they did themselves. It was equally
so with all strangers whom he met, and frequently ludicrous
scenes resulted from his insatiable desire to trace pedigree.
Whilst a delegate from this State to the Montgomery Convention,
which organized the Confederacy in 1861, he was introduced
to a distinguished gentleman, and without letting go
his hand, which he took to shake, he stopped in the midst
of the flow of ceremonious speech, and, to the no small amusement
of the bystanders, said: "Sir, was not your mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
maiden name Jones?" I doubt if there is a single
family on the Atlantic coast, whose members have borne
any prominent part in the affairs of the country, in regard
to which he did not have more or less of information&mdash;at
least, he could have told all about its leading representatives.
With a very little help indeed he could have supplied a
"Doomsday Book" of North Carolina, more accurate by far
than that of the Conqueror. It was generally understood
at Chapel Hill that if you wanted to know <em>what anything
was</em>, you went to Dr. Mitchell; if you wanted to know <em>who
anybody was</em>, you went to Governor Swain.</p>

<p>And as he never forgot face, or name, or lineage of the
man once known to him, so he never forgot a kindness or a
favor once done to him or his, and loved to continue such
memories, and extend the chain of friendship to second and
third generations. "Thine own, and thy father's friend
forsake not," was one of his favorite maxims. He was utterly
incapable of resisting an appeal for mercy, or a tale of distress.
This was, I believe, the only objection urged against
his conduct on the bench&mdash;his leniency to criminals. So too
arose the only serious trouble he ever had with the Trustees
of the University. Stringent measures had been resolved
upon by the Board towards dissipation and insubordination
among the students, which were not rigidly enforced by Governor
Swain. So great was his forbearance with the hot
blood of youth, and so strong his faith that time would cure
these early follies, and enable the better natures of the young
men to assert themselves, that he suffered the Draconian code
of the Trustees to lie dormant, whilst he lectured, reproved,
and exhorted. He shrank from branding the opening years
of a young life with sentence of dismission or expulsion, and
would condescend to an erring boy while there remained the
last hope of reform. In such cases his judgment not unfrequently
came into conflict with the opinions of other members
of the faculty, and finally so irritated the Trustees that
they passed a resolution of censure upon him, which was publicly
read from the platform of the chapel by no less a personage
than Governor Iredell. Quite a scene was excited on
this occasion, and when Governor Swain arose and replied in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
his own vindication, it was with much emotion, not unmingled
with indignation; "More," says Mr. Cameron, who was present,
"than I ever knew him to exhibit on any occasion, before
or since."</p>

<p>The lapse of time has shown this policy to have been the
best and wisest not only for the young men themselves, but
for the institution, and for his own fame. Who of all the
hundreds to whom he thus stood in the attitude of a father,
kind, and long-suffering, and hopeful, but now recalls him
with affection and gratitude; how many a one remembers
his college-life at Chapel Hill as the turning point of his
career, where he was won by undeserved kindness to paths of
honor, not repelled by judicial severity, and feels in his heart
that under God he owes all that he has of fortune, friends or
fame to the University and its wise head!</p>

<p>While the Governor remained in political life his extraordinary
memory of persons and names and events gave him a
wonderful advantage. There is no more successful way of
making one's self agreeable to the multitude than by knowing
men when you meet them, and calling them by name. Not
to recognize a man who has stood your friend, and fought
your battles at the polls, is always an omission of evil omen
in his eyes, and a bad memory for names will not always
apologize for what seems to be neglect. Many and many
are the shifts of the politician to avoid this fatal predicament.
But I venture to say that Governor Swain was never caught
in such a way. Once being introduced, he never forgot his
man, nor his family connections. After the surrender of
General Lee in 1865, when General Sherman had begun his
march upon Raleigh, at the earnest request of Mr. B.F.
Moore and Mr. Kenneth Rayner, I sent an embassy to meet
the federal commander, and obtain what terms were possible
for the surrender of the capital of the State.</p>

<p>Having confidence in their firmness and discretion, I
selected Governors Swain and Graham, who left in a few
moments after their appointment, on a special train, accompanied
by Dr. Edward Warren, Surgeon-General of the State.
I remarked, after their departure with my letter, as one reason
for selecting him, that I had no doubt Governor Swain would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
find plenty of acquaintances in the enemy's camp, or at least
would prove that he knew the fathers of many of the officers.
And so it was; on his arrival at headquarters, he not only
claimed General Sherman as an old correspondent, and fellow-college-president,
but immediately seized upon two or three
members of the staff whose parents and pedigree he knew,
and was soon at home among them.</p>

<p>And here perhaps it is not improper in me to correct a
statement made by General Sherman in his memoirs in relation
to this embassy. Referring to it, that General says:
"They had come with a flag of truce, to which they were
not entitled; still, in the interests of peace, I respected it,
and permitted them to return to Raleigh with their locomotive,
to assure the Governor of the State and the people,
that the war was substantially over, and that I wanted the
civil authorities to remain in the execution of their office
till the pleasure of the President could be ascertained. On
reaching Raleigh I found these same gentlemen with Messrs.
Bragg, Badger, Holden and others, but Governor Vance had
fled, and could not be prevailed on to return, because he
feared arrest and imprisonment." This statement is uncandid,
not to say untruthful, by implication at least. These
gentlemen <em>had</em> a right to the flag of truce, for it was sent
with the consent and by permission of General Hardee, commanding
the Confederate forces in the absence of General
Johnston, and should not have been permitted to enter the
enemy's lines if the bearers were not entitled to carry it. It
was <em>not</em> respected, for it was fired upon by Kilpatrick's men,
and "captured," as they claimed, and the gentlemen composing
the embassy were promptly and skillfully robbed of
their surplus personalty, and were conducted as "<em>prisoners</em>"
to General Sherman's headquarters. They were <em>not</em> permitted
promptly, as the statement implies, to return with their
locomotive, with assurances of peace and protection, but were
detained there the entire day and night after their arrival
within Sherman's lines, until he no doubt knew that Raleigh
was entirely uncovered by Johnston's troops. Of course, all
the officers of the State government who did not wish to surrender
at discretion, left with the Confederate troops, for, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
embassy not returning, and no news of its fate, except that it
had been captured, and no reply to my letter being received,
they had no assurance of protection. Governor Swain states
in his address at the opening of Tucker Hall that on the
return of the embassy that memorable morning, but a few
minutes in advance of the Federal troops, the city was
shrouded in silence and gloom, except for the presence of a
few marauding stragglers from Wheeler's cavalry, showing
conclusively that the city was uncovered when he arrived
with Sherman's message. It was some days afterwards, and
at Hillsborough, when I learned from Governor Graham the
result of his mission, and it was then far too late for me, consistently
with other duties, to accept of Sherman's offer of
protection, had any one convinced me that it was best to do
so, which indeed no one did. My inclinations, I confess, were
to be with that little army, fully one-third of whom were
North Carolinians, until they laid down their arms. I am
happy to reflect that I shared their fate to the last.</p>

<p>This much to vindicate the truth of history. Throughout
this whole transaction, as many gentlemen have testified to
me, Governor Swain's bearing was, in the highest degree,
courageous, discreet, and manly.</p>

<p>During the war his efforts had mainly been directed to
keeping the college alive, for such was the impetuosity with
which the call to arms was obeyed, that of the eighty members,
of which the freshman class consisted in 1860, but <em>one</em>
(in delicate health) remained to pursue his studies. (Of the
senior class of that date not one had remained out of the army,
and fully one-fourth of them fell in battle.) Seven members
of the faculty volunteered, and of them <em>five</em> returned no more.</p>

<p>Governor Swain appealed to the Confederate Government
more than once to prevent the handful of college boys left
from being drafted. President Davis himself seconded these
efforts in the earlier years of the war, declaring that "the
<em>seed-corn</em> should not be ground up." But as the exigencies
of the country increased, this wisdom was lost sight of, the
collegians were again and again called upon, till at the time
of Lee's surrender there were but about a dozen here, still
keeping up the name and forms of a college. But even while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the village and University were occupied by four thousand
Michigan cavalry, the old bell was rung daily, prayers were
held, and the University was <em>kept going</em>. The Governor took
a pride in this, and hoped that he was to tell it many years
after. But this long and useful life, devoted to the best interests
of his country and his age, was nearing its close. Only
three years yet remained to him, and these were devoted by
him to earnest, unceasing endeavors to reinstate the University
pecuniarily, and to recall its former patronage. Darker
days, however, were in store for it, which he in the good
providence of God was not to be permitted to see.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1868, the State passing under a new
Constitution, and an entire change of government, the University
also fell into new hands, whose first action was to
request the resignation of the president and faculty, most of
whom had grown grey in service to the State. A guard of
negroes were sent to take possession, and these halls were
closed. Governor Swain was then preparing for a visit to
Buncombe. On the 11th day of August, while driving in
the neighborhood of Chapel Hill, with Professor Fetter, he
was thrown from the buggy, and brought home painfully,
but as was then supposed, not seriously injured. Confined
to his bed for about two weeks, he appeared to be recovering,
when on the morning of the 27th he suddenly fainted, and
expired without pain.</p>

<p>He was in the full possession of all his faculties up to the
last moment, and died at peace with all the world; a fitting
close to a life of beneficence and integrity. There is a melancholy
coincidence in the manner of his death with that of his
two oldest friends and colaborers in the faculty who had preceded
him over the river, and were "resting under the shade
of the trees." Dr. Elisha Mitchell perished by falling down
a precipice in the cataracts of the Black Mountain, June 27,
1857. Dr. James Phillips sank down suddenly on the rostrum
while in the act of conducting morning prayers, and
died without a struggle, March 14, 1867. Thus all of these
eminent men, worthy servants of Christianity and civilization,
died suddenly, or with some degree of violence.</p>

<p>A just estimate of the talents and character of Governor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Swain, for reasons already indicated, is not easily made plain
to popular apprehension. By the world the term "great"
is variously applied, and misapplied. It is often withheld
when it is mostly richly deserved; not, because of the injustice
of contemporaries, for personal prejudice rarely outlives
a generation, but because men rarely appreciate the full extent
and character of the labors of a lifetime. And especially
is this true when that life has been mainly spent in the planting
of moral seeds below the surface, which, perhaps for
years, make no great show of the harvest which is sure to
come. Generations are sometimes required to elapse before
the world can see the golden sheaves which cover and adorn
the landscape, the result of that patient and judicious planting.</p>

<p>They who in life are followed by the noisy plaudits of the
crowd, who fill the largest space in the eyes of their contemporaries,
and seem to tower far above their fellows, are not
always found to have their reputation built on the securest
foundations, nor to have left their mark on the age in which
they lived. Erasmus was esteemed by his generation a much
greater man than Luther. He was one of the most remarkable
men of his century, few indeed have equaled him in
keenness of intellect, and in depth and extent of learning.
Yet, viewed now in the light of their labors, and the value
and significance of their impression on the world, what a
veritable shadow he was by the side of the plainer, less
learned, but downright monk! Erasmus is known to the
scholars who search for his name and works in the cyclopædias;
the name and the spirit of Luther pervade and affect
the civilization of the whole world.</p>

<p>On the 21st of February, 1677, there died in a small house
in the Hague a man whose greatness could not be measured,
says his biographer, until humanity had moved to the proper
prospective point at the distance of more than a century.
The view enlarged as time rolled on, as it does to men climbing
high mountains; in 1877, the world agrees to number him
among the undoubted sons of genius, and benefactors of mankind.
His admirers erect a monument to his memory just
two hundred years after his death in the same city where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was persecuted, excommunicated, and his works destroyed.
His name was Spinoza. Modest, and pure, and upright, he
had the misfortune to live two hundred years before his age,
and to put forth fruits of genius which his fellows could not
comprehend, and so they stamped him and them into dust as
being unorthodox. Two centuries of progress have brought
the world up to where Spinoza died, and it builds him a
monument. At last, his work is seen.</p>

<p>The Earl of Murray, Lord Regent of Scotland, was not
esteemed a great man in his day. His behavior was modest,
his abilities were apparently but moderate, and for more than
two hundred years he has figured in history as an ordinary
man, overlaid by the more violent and intriguing spirits of
his time, and his character obscured and distorted by the
glamour which surrounds the name of his beauteous but
abandoned sister and murderess, Queen Mary. And yet
when two centuries afterwards the spirit of philosophic history
comes to trace cause and effect, and to show the result of
his life's work upon Protestant Christianity, and what he contributed
to the domination of the English-speaking races, we
agree at once with Mr. Froude that he was in truth one of
the best and greatest of men, a benefactor of mankind.</p>

<p>And so it may be said of Bunyan, of Wesley, and of many
more, whose beginnings were esteemed but of small account,
but whose fame has continually grown brighter and brighter,
as the world has been forced to see how wisely they builded.</p>

<p>In many senses of the term Governor Swain was not a
great man. As an author, though a man of letters, he neither
achieved nor attempted anything lasting. As a politician,
though he rose rapidly to the highest honors of his native
State, he did not strikingly impress himself upon his times
by any great speech, nor by any grand stroke of policy. In
this respect he was inferior to many of his contemporaries
who constituted, perhaps, the brightest cluster of names in
our annals. As a lawyer and a judge, he occupied comparatively
about the same position; and as a scholar he was not to
be distinguished, being inferior to several of his colaborers in
the University. But in many things he was entitled to be
called great, if we mean by that term that he so used the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
faculties he possessed that he raised himself beyond and
above the great mass of his fellows. In him there was a
rounded fullness of the qualities, intellectual and moral,
which constitute the excellence of manhood, in a degree never
excelled by any citizen of North Carolina whom I have personally
known, except by William A. Graham. If there was
in Swain no one grand quality of intellect which lifted him
out of comparison with any but the demigods of our race,
neither was there any element so wanting as to sink him into
or below the common mass. If there were in him no Himalayan
peaks of genius, piercing into the regions of everlasting
frost and ice, neither were there any yawning chasms or slimy
pools below the tide-waters of mediocrity. He rose from the
plain of his fellow-men like the Alleghanies, in whose bosom
he was born, by regular and easy gradations&mdash;so easy that
you know not how high you are until you turn to gaze backward&mdash;every
step surrounded by beauty and fertility&mdash;until
he rested high over all the land. If there be those who
singly tower above him in gifts, or attainments, or distinctions,
there are none whom as a whole we can contemplate
with more interest, affection, and admiration; none whose
work for North Carolina will prove to be more valuable, or
more lasting, or more important to future generations; none to
whom, at the great final review, the greeting may be more
heartily addressed: "<em>Servant of God, well done!</em>"</p>

<p>No estimate of Governor Swain's walk through life should
omit the consideration of his Christian character. It was
especially marked by catholicity of feeling towards all good
men of whatever name. He was accustomed to refer this to
the circumstances of his bringing up. He would say: "My
father was a Presbyterian elder, and an Arminian; my mother
was a Methodist and a Calvinist, who loved and studied
Scott's commentary. Their house was the home for preachers
of all sorts west of the Blue Ridge. Bishop Asbury
blessed me when a child. Mr. Newton, a Presbyterian,
taught me when a boy, and Humphrey Posey, a Baptist, used
to pray for me when a youth. So I love all who show that
they are Christians."</p>

<p>On his death-bed he spoke often of the communion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
saints with, one another, and with their Head. He was a
decided Presbyterian, however; he admired what he called
"the symmetry" of the ecclesiastical system of his church;
he dwelt on its history with great delight, and was accustomed
to find support for his soul in times of deep distress in its interpretations
of the Bible. He was a praying man, and not
ashamed to be known as such. He first introduced the practice
of opening the regular meetings of the faculty with
prayer. The night before he died he said of the Lord's
Prayer: "The oftener I use it the more precious it is to me;
it contains a whole body of divinity."</p>

<p>In private life he was most upright, kind, social, and hospitable.
An excellent financier, he left a handsome estate,
even "after the war." He had a proper conception of the
value of wealth, and all his life practiced a judicious economy,
but he knew well both how to lend and how to give. His
conversation was delightfully interesting and instructive, replete
with anecdote, genial humor, historical incident, or literary
quotation. Few men of his associates equaled him in
these respects, even after the infirmity of deafness had cut
him off from much social enjoyment.</p>

<p>His remains lie buried in Oakwood Cemetery, near Raleigh,
and close beside the sleeping soldiers of the Confederacy.
The soil of our State holds the dust of no son who loved her
more or served her better. Peaceful be his rest, as he waits
for the clear breaking of the day over the brow of the eternal
hills.</p>

<h3><a name="EARLY_TIMES_IN_RALEIGH" id="EARLY_TIMES_IN_RALEIGH">EARLY TIMES IN RALEIGH.</a></h3>

<p class="center">ADDRESS BY D. L. SWAIN.</p>


<p>There were few more exciting topics in ante-revolutionary
times than the location of the seat of government.</p>

<p>The first General Assembly, in relation to which we have
much authentic information, met at the house of Captain
Richard Sanderson, on Little River, in the county of Perquimans,
in 1715, and revised the whole body of the public
statute law.</p>

<p>The style of enactment is characteristic of the times and
of the proprietary government: "Be it enacted by his Excellency
the Palatine and the rest of the true and absolute Lords
Proprietors of Carolina, by and with the advice and consent
of this present General Assembly, now met at Little River,
for the northeastern part of this province."</p>

<p>From Little River the seat of legislation was transferred in
1720 to the General Court House at Queen Anne's Creek, in
Chowan Precinct, and in 1723 to Edenton.</p>

<p>In 1731 the Proprietary was succeeded by the Royal Government,
and in 1734 the legislative will assumed a form of
expression worthy of eastern despotism: "We pray that it
may be enacted, and be it enacted by his Excellency, Gabriel
Johnston, Esq., Governor, by and with the advice and consent
of his Majesty's council in the General Assembly of this
province."</p>

<p>In 1741 the General Assembly met at Wilmington, but
returned the following year to Edenton. From 1745 to
1761, with the exception of a single session at Bath, it convened
at New Bern. In 1761 it met again at Wilmington,
and from that time keen rivalry was maintained between
New Bern and Wilmington for metropolitan distinction, until
quieted by the Act of 1766, authorizing the construction of
Governor Tryon's viceregal palace at New Bern. This edifice,
completed in 1770, dedicated to Sir William Draper&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the subject of his muse in an attempt at Roman versification&mdash;was
pronounced on good authority, in 1783, superior
to any structure of the kind in British or South America.</p>

<p>During the Revolution the General Assembly met somewhat
in accordance with the exigencies of the times, at New
Bern, Kinston, Halifax, Smithfield, Wake Court House,
Hillsborough and Salem.</p>

<p>In 1782 and 1783 the Legislature convened at Hillsborough,
and in 1784 and 1785 at New Bern, in 1786 at Fayetteville,
in 1787 at Tarborough, and in 1788 returned to
Fayetteville.</p>

<p>In 1787 the General Assembly had resolved that it "be
recommended to the people of the State to authorize and
direct their representatives in the convention called to consider
the Federal Constitution to fix on the place for the
unalterable seat of government."</p>

<p>The convention met at Hillsborough in August, 1788, and
resolved that "this convention will not fix the seat of government
at one particular point, but that it shall be left to the
discretion of the Assembly to ascertain the exact spot, provided
always, that it shall be within ten miles of the plantation
whereon Isaac Hunter now resides, in the county of
Wake."</p>

<p>The following editorial article is copied from the <cite>Fayetteville
Chronicle</cite> or <cite>North Carolina Gazette</cite> of the 29th of November,
1790:</p>

<p>"On Thursday last the bill for carrying into effect the
Ordinance of the Convention held at Hillsborough in 1788
for holding the future meetings of the General Assembly,
etc., came before the House of Commons, when the question
was put, Shall this bill pass? The House divided, and there
appeared fifty-one for it and fifty-one against it, whereupon
the Speaker [Mr. Cabarrus] gave his own vote, and pronounced
the passage of the bill. It was then sent to the
Senate, when that House divided, and there appeared an
equal number of votes for and against the passage of the bill,
whereupon the Speaker [General Lenoir] gave the casting
vote against its passage, and the bill was rejected."</p>

<p>In 1791, however, the General Assembly met at New Bern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and in compliance with the positive constitutional injunction,
passed an act to carry the ordinance of 1788 into effect. The
act provides that ten persons shall be appointed to lay off
and locate the city within ten miles of the plantation of Isaac
Hunter, and five persons "to cause to be built and erected
a State-house sufficiently large to accommodate with convenience
both houses of the General Assembly, at an expense
not to exceed ten thousand pounds."</p>

<p>In the following year (1792) a majority of the commissioners,
to wit: Frederic Hargett, Willie Jones, Joseph McDowell,
Thomas Blount, William Johnson Dawson, and
James Martin, met on the 4th of April, and on the following
day purchased of Colonel Joel Lane one thousand acres of
land, and laid off the plan of a city, containing four hundred
acres, arranged in five squares of four acres and two hundred
and seventy-six lots of one acre each: Caswell Square (the
site of the Institute for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind),
the northwestern; Burke (the site of the Raleigh Academy)
[now the Governor's Mansion], the northeastern; Nash, the
southwestern; Moore the southeastern, and Union, on which
the State-house stands, the central square.</p>

<p>The names of the towns towards which the principal streets
ran gave them their designation, and the names of the commissioners
and other prominent citizens were applied to the
others. New Bern, Hillsborough, Halifax, and Fayetteville
streets were ninety-nine, and all the other streets sixty-six
feet in width.</p>

<p>In December, 1794, the General Assembly met in the new
State-house for the first time.</p>

<p>In 1802 an act was passed requiring the Governor to reside
at the seat of government, and a plain two-story frame building,
painted white, and an office on the corner, were provided
on lot No. 131. This first gubernatorial mansion was
subsequently the residence of the late James Coman. The
First National Bank of North Carolina now occupies the site
from which the first executive office and Mr. Coman's brick
store were successively removed.</p>

<p>In 1813 the General Assembly appointed Henry Potter,
Henry Seawell, William Hinton, Nathaniel Jones, Theophilus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Hunter, and William Peace, commissioners to erect on the
public lands near the city of Raleigh a convenient and commodious
dwelling-house for the Governor, at a cost not to
exceed five thousand pounds, to be derived from the sale of
lots which they were authorized to lay off, and from the sale
of lot No. 131, referred to as the residence, at successive
periods, of Governors Turner, Alexander, Williams, Stone,
Smith, and Hawkins.</p>

<p>The site selected for the new gubernatorial residence, in
common parlance the "Palace," was near the terminus of
Fayetteville street, directly south of and fronting the capitol,
and just beyond the southern boundary of the city. The
edifice was completed during Governor Miller's administration,
from 1813 to 1816, and he was the first occupant.</p>

<p>In 1819, Duncan Cameron, John Winslow, Joseph Gales,
William Robards, and Henry Potter were authorized to sell
all or any part of the lands purchased of Joel Lane, with the
exception of the stone-quarry, in lots to suit purchasers. The
Governor was authorized, from the proceeds of the sale, to
improve the State-house under the direction of the State
architect, and in conformity with a plan which he had prepared
and submitted to the General Assembly.</p>

<p>The old State-house, which is believed to have been constructed
from the net proceeds of the sales of city lots in 1792,
was described by a writer of the time as a huge, misshapen
pile. In form it was substantially, so far as the body of the
building was concerned, though on a smaller scale, very similar
to the present edifice. It was divided by broad passages
on the ground floor from north to south and from east to
west, intersecting in the center at right angles. The offices
of the Secretary, Public Treasurer and Comptroller were on
the lower floor. The Senate chamber and hall of the House
of Commons, with the offices appurtenant, above, as at present.
The executive office, as has been stated, was contiguous
to the palatial residence. The passages and halls of the first
State-house supplied all, and more than all, the accommodation
to the public contemplated by the founders of this less
extensive, but better furnished, and more finely finished edifice
[referring to Tucker Hall]. Here divine worship on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Sabbath, balls on festive occasions, theatrical representations,
sleight-of-hand performances, and last but not least, fourth-of-July
orations and fourth-of-July dinners, all found their
places, and their votaries for a time. The construction of the
dome, the erection of the east and west porticoes, the additional
elevation and covering of stucco given to the dingy
exterior walls, the improvement of the interior, and especially
the location of the statue of Washington, from the chisel of
Canova (a noble specimen of a noble art, commemorative of
the noblest of men), in the rotunda at the point of intersection
of the passages directly under the apex of the dome,
converted the renovated capitol into a sightly and most attractive
edifice. There were but few of the better class of travelers,
who did not pause on their passage through Raleigh,
to behold and admire it. The improvements were designed
by, and executed under, the supervision of Captain William
Nichols, then recently appointed State architect, and completed
early in the summer of 1822. He was a skillful and
experienced artist, and made the public greatly his debtor for
a decided impulse given to architectural improvements
throughout the State, in private as well as in public edifices.</p>

<p>It was my lot on the 21st of June, 1831, to stand a helpless
spectator, when that noble edifice, adorned with the statue
of the father of his country, was a sheet of blinding, hissing
flame, and to hear, amidst the almost breathless silence of the
stupified multitude around it, the piteous exclamation of a
child: "Poor State-house, poor statue, I so sorry." There
were thousands of adults present as sorrowful and as powerless
as that child.</p>

<p>It was my lot as Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth,
on the fourth day of July, 1833, to lay the corner-stone of
the present capitol, supposed on its completion to be the most
magnificent structure of the kind in the Union.</p>

<p>It was my lot on the morning of the 13th of April, 1865,
as the friend and representative of Governor Vance, to find,
on approaching the southern front of the capitol, the doors
and windows closed, and a deeper, more dreadful silence
shrouding the city than during the sad catastrophe to which
I have referred. I met at the south front of the capitol, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a negro servant, who waited on the executive department,
the only human being who had dared to venture beyond
his doors. He delivered me the keys, and assisted me in opening
the doors and windows of the executive office, and I took
my station at the entrance, with a safe-conduct from General
Sherman in my hand, prepared to surrender the capitol at
the demand of his approaching forces. At that moment a
band of marauders, stragglers from Wheeler's retiring cavalry,
dismounted at the head of Fayetteville street, and began to
sack the stores directly contiguous to and south of Dr. Haywood's
residence. I apprised them immediately that Sherman's
army was just at hand; that any show of resistance
might result in the destruction of the city, and urged them
to follow their retreating comrades. A citizen, the first I saw
beyond his threshold that morning, came up at the moment
and united his remonstrances to mine, but all in vain, until
I perceived, and announced, that the head of Kilpatrick's
column was in sight. In a moment every member of the
band, with the exception of their chivalric leader, was in the
saddle, and his horse spurred to his utmost speed. He drew
his bridle-rein, halted in the center of the street, and discharged
his revolver until his stock of ammunition was expended
in the direction, but not in carrying distance of his
foe, when he too fled, but attempted to run the gauntlet in
vain. His life was the forfeit at a very brief interval.</p>

<p>The remains of this bold man rest in the cemetery, covered
with garlands and bewept by beautiful maidens, little
aware how nearly the city may have been on the verge of
devastation, and how narrowly the fairest of their number
may have escaped insult and death from this rash act of
lawless warfare. The bones of the old North Carolinian,
the founder of the city thus imperiled, moulder in the midst
of other unrecorded dead, beneath the shade of a mulberry
on his ancient domain, about as far west as those of the young
Texan east of the capitol.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, in company with Governor
Graham, who had risked life and reputation in behalf
of this community to an extent of which those who derived
the advantage are little aware, I delivered the keys of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
State-house to General Sherman, at the gubernatorial mansion,
then his headquarters, and received his assurance that
the capitol and city should be protected, and the rights of
private property duly regarded.</p>

<p>May I be pardoned in connection with this narrative, for
a brief reference to an incident in my personal history, illustrative
of the character of one of the purest, as well as the
wisest, men I have ever known. At our first interview after
I was elected Superior Court Judge in 1831, Mr. Gaston,
who was then at the bar, and who, from our earliest acquaintance,
had treated me with the kindness of a father, after
cordial congratulations on my elevation to the bench, took
occasion to advise me most earnestly never to permit myself,
except under an overpowering sense of public duty, to be
seduced into a return to political life. He said he was growing
old, and endeavored, as much as possible, to withdraw
attention from the threatening aspect of public affairs, but
there were sleepless hours, when he could not avoid reflection
on the utter heartlessness of party politicians, and the difficulty
of preserving a conscience void of offense, when mingling
in political controversies&mdash;that he had always endeavored
to place country above party, and that yet, on a calm review
of his whole course of life, too many instances presented
themselves, when he convicted himself of having been influenced
to an extent of which he had no suspicion at the
moment, by other than purely patriotic considerations. In
addition to all this, it had been his fate on repeated occasions
to be most loudly applauded for what, in his own conscience,
he regarded as least praiseworthy, and to be bitterly reviled
for what he considered to have been the purest and most discreet
acts of his public life.</p>

<p>In 1812, and along about that time, the only newspapers
in Raleigh were <cite>The Raleigh Register</cite> and <cite>The Star</cite>, both
published weekly. <cite>The Minerva</cite> had been discontinued.</p>

<p>From 1792 until the publication of <cite>The Raleigh Register</cite>,
in the autumn of 1799, <cite>The North Carolina Journal</cite> was
the great advertising medium for the portion of the State
north and west of Halifax.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among the merchant princes of that day were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the brothers, Joseph and William Peace. They occupied a
one-story frame building, perhaps 20x24, nearly opposite to
W. C. and R. Tucker. The junior partner informed me
many years ago that he had ordinarily purchased goods twice
a year, always for cash, and always at ten per cent. discount,
and that the advantage thus obtained over those who bought
upon credit was the nucleus of the large estate he had realized.
He was kind enough in October, 1822, as soon as I
was able to travel, after recovering from severe illness, to
drive me from Raleigh to the hospitable mansion of the late
General Calvin Jones, the present site of Wake Forest College.
On the way he related various incidents in his personal
history, which interested me. Referring to the success of an
eminent lawyer and statesman, as estimable in private as
distinguished in public life, he stated that that gentleman,
who was licensed to practice law during his minority, applied
to him shortly thereafter for a suit of clothes upon credit;
that he had always made it a rule to meet such requests with
such prompt compliance as to impress the applicant with a
grateful sense of the confidence reposed, or, with so blank a
denial as to shield him from future annoyance. In this instance
he admitted that he hesitated. The appearance and
manner of the applicant impressed him most favorably, but
he was very young as well as very needy, and the Captain had
learned from previous experience that the young lawyer's
prospects were a contingent remainder, which required a particular
estate of freehold to support them. It afforded him
great gratification to remember that his kind impulses prevailed,
and that he cut off the goods with great seeming cheerfulness.</p>

<p>I had no suspicion until three months afterwards that the
story could point a moral in relation to myself. At the close
of a casual interview, after the recovery of my health, he
said: "Mr. Swain, perhaps it is convenient for you to pay for
that suit of clothes now." "What suit, Captain?" "The suit
you purchased some time since." I replied, "I never bought
anything of you in my life but one bandanna handkerchief,
and I paid for that when I got it." He turned to his book
and showed me an account for a full suit of black, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
September 10. "On that day, Captain, I was sick in bed,
and my life despaired of by my physicians." "Oh! I remember
it was F&mdash;&mdash; got the clothes." He was sent for, and in
reply to my inquiry whether he ever got a suit of clothes for
me, replied he did. "Had you any order from me to do
so?" "No, sir; but you were expected to die every hour, I
knew you had no burial suit, and thought it my duty, as your
tailor, to provide one." "Where are the clothes?" "When
I found you were getting well I sold them." "What right
had you to consider yourself my tailor?" "I made a pair
of pantaloons for you last spring." At the close of the dialogue
the Captain remarked: "I claim nothing from you,
Mr. Swain." The tailor left the store under the decided
impression that his best interests would be served by a prompt
settlement of the account. Had I died, a punctual but not
opulent father, would have paid the bill upon presentation
without inquiry.</p>

<p>The late William Boylan, the first editor of <cite>The Raleigh
Minerva</cite>, and the immediate successor of Colonel Polk as
President of the State Bank, was a gentleman sedate and
grave in manner to a degree that to a stranger might have
been taken for austerity. Traveling from Raleigh to Pittsborough
about 1800, he and Mr. Peace, on reaching the
election ground at Brassfields, found a multitude assembled
engaged in dancing and other rural sports, in the free-and-easy
manner characteristic of the time and place. Mr. Peace
was comparatively at home. Mr. Boylan stood aloof until
a rowdy approached and invited him to enter the ring with
the dancers. On his declining, a dozen came forward, prepared
to coerce the submission of the proud aristocrat. In
an instant Mr. Peace, with great solemnity, beckoned the
leader of the band aside, and whispered: "My friend, be
careful how you act. Bless your life, that is Mr. Boylan,
the man who made the almanac, and can foretell eclipses and
thunder-storms." The reference to the almanac-maker secured
at once the most deferential respect for the distinguished
visitor.</p>

<p>The late William Glendennin (one of the old merchants)
resided and did business during many years in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
nearly opposite the old State Bank, the recent residence of
Colonel William J. Clarke. He built a meeting-house at his
own expense at a very early period in the history of the city,
and during a series of years previous to the erection of any
other church, ministered in his peculiar manner at his own
altar, without earthly fee or reward, to all who chose to hear
him. His deserted tabernacle was pointed out to me, when
I first knew Raleigh, standing a little south of the corner, at
the intersection of Morgan with Blount street. I remember
to have seen, in my early boyhood, his autobiography, recounting
numerous conflicts, spiritual and physical, with the
arch-enemy of the human race. His little volume is probably
out of print. It would be a rare curiosity, at the present
time, in many respects. Notwithstanding these vagaries, he
was shrewd and systematic in business, and in due time accumulated
a handsome fortune for that day. His eccentricities
increased, however, to such an extent that a guardianship became
necessary, and Mr. Boylan was selected as the person
possessing the requisite nerve and tact to control and manage
him.</p>

<p>As soon as Glendennin was apprised of the arrangement
his confidential clerk, the late Robert Harrison, was dispatched
to invite Mr. Boylan to his house. When he entered,
Glendennin requested him to take a book from the mantelpiece,
which proved to be the Bible, and it disclosed, at opening,
a fifty-dollar bill. "The foul fiend was here last night
and told me that he had come for the soul of old &mdash;&mdash;.
I obtained a year's respite for fifty dollars, and the fiend is
to take the money from that book at midnight." Glancing
his eye inquiringly at Mr. Boylan, "I understand that you
are my guardian, and I wish to know how I am to act, and
what I am to do?" Mr. Boylan intimated that as little
change as possible would be made in the management of his
affairs. "Mr. Harrison will keep the keys, sell goods, and
collect debts, as heretofore." "Am I to be master of my own
house?" "Certainly." "May I invite any one I choose
into my house?" "Oh, yes; just as heretofore." "May I
order a man out, when I don't want him here?" No sooner
had Mr. Boylan given an intimation in the affirmative than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Glendennin, with a frenzied glare, stamping his foot, and
clenching his fist, cried out: "Then, sir, get out of my house;
get out of my house, this instant!"</p>

<p>The poor old gentleman died in the summer of 1816, leaving
a very pretty property for two nieces in Scotland.</p>

<p>The recent abstraction of records from the executive and
other public offices, by persons acting under the authority of
the Federal Government, renders it impossible to give as
minute an account of an interesting event as I would like to
present. As I must relate the circumstances entirely from
memory, after the lapse of more than thirty years from the
time the records were at my command, allowance must
be made for a want of precision, especially as to dates.</p>

<p>During Governor Ashe's administration, embracing the
years 1796, 1797, and 1798, it was ascertained that numerous
frauds had been perpetrated in the office of the Secretary
of State and the offices of John and Martin Armstrong,
in the entry and survey of western lands, and active exertions
were made to discover and arrest the offenders in this
State and Tennessee. It was, I think, in 1797, that a confidential
messenger was sent by Judges Tatum and McNairy
from Nashville to the Governor to warn him of a conspiracy
to burn the State-house, in order to destroy the records, the
production of which upon the trial was indispensable to the
conviction of the offenders. A guard was armed and stationed
around the capitol for the next two months. The
communication from Nashville requested the Governor, immediately
on its receipt, to erase from the despatch the name
of the messenger who bore it, as any discovery of his connection
with it would lead to assassination. This was done so
carefully as to elude every effort on my part to restore and
ascertain it, thirty years ago, and I have not at the present
moment the slightest suspicion of the agent who overheard
the plot of the conspirators in Knoxville and was sent from
Nashville to Raleigh on this secret and dangerous mission.</p>

<p>The earliest letter I ever saw from General Jackson was in
relation to this affair. With his instinctive hatred of fraud,
he tendered his service to the Governor in any effort that
might be necessary to arrest the offenders who were supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to have sought refuge in the then Spanish domains in the
direction of Mobile. This letter was on file in the executive
office in 1835.</p>

<p>In 1797, according to my remembrance, on the night
when the ball was given at Casso's hotel to the bridal party,
very shortly after the second marriage of the Public Treasurer,
the festivities were interrupted by the hasty entrance of a
servant, with the information that some one was forcing an
entrance into the window of the office, where the trunk containing
the records in question was deposited. He was
caught, was ascertained to be the slave of one of the persons
charged with fraud, was convicted of burglary, and executed.</p>

<p>In 1799 the General Assembly passed the act directing the
Judges of the Superior Courts to meet together to settle questions
of law and equity arising upon their circuits, and to
provide for the trial of all persons concerned in the commission
of frauds in the several land offices. This act was carefully
and skillfully drawn, consisted of fifteen sections, and,
voluminous as it was, contained more than met the eye of the
ordinary observer: the germ of the present Supreme Court,
notwithstanding the proviso in the closing section, "that this
act shall continue in force from its commencement only for
two years, and from thence to the end of the next succeeding
General Assembly" was contained in that act.</p>

<p>Under the provisions of this act Colonel James Glasgow,
the Secretary of State, was indicted for a misdemeanor in the
fraudulent issue of land-warrants. The four judges of the
Superior Courts were John Haywood, Spruce Macay, John
Louis Taylor, Samuel Johnston. Blake Baker was Attorney-General,
and Edward Jones, Solicitor-General. The latter
seems to have been mainly relied on to conduct the prosecution.</p>

<p>The commission under which the court was held was
drawn by Judge Haywood. While on his way to Raleigh
to meet his brother judges he accepted a fee of one thousand
dollars, resigned his seat upon the bench, and undertook the
defense of Glasgow.</p>

<p>There has rarely convened from that day to this, even after
the resignation of Haywood, an abler tribunal, on any occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
or for any purpose, than that which tried and convicted
the distinguished culprit. In relation to the advocate the
late Judge Hall remarks in a judicial opinion delivered in
1828: "I shall not treat with disrespect the memory of the
dead nor the pretensions of the living, when I say that a
greater criminal lawyer than Judge Haywood never sat upon
the bench in North Carolina." The General Assembly in
anticipation of the judgment of the court, in 1799, changed
the name of the county of Glasgow, erected in 1791, to the
county of Greene.</p>

<p>Duncan Cameron, at the early age of twenty-three, was the
clerk, and immediately after the close of the trial reported
and published the decisions of the court in an octavo of one
hundred and eight pages. As I have the only copy I have
ever seen of this brochure, the earliest, with the exception
of <cite>Martin</cite> and <cite>1 Haywood</cite>, in the entire series of North
Carolina Reports, I give for the benefit of legal antiquarians
an exact copy of the title-page: "Reports of cases determined
by the Judges of the Superior Courts of law and Court of
Equity of the State of North Carolina, at their meeting on
10th of June, A. D. 1800, held pursuant to an act of the
General Assembly for settling questions of law and equity
arising on the circuit, by Duncan Cameron, attorney at law,
Raleigh. From the press of Hodge &amp; Boylan, printers to the
State, 1800."</p>

<p>In 1800 an act was passed to continue in force the Act of
1799, three years longer. The sessions of the court by the
former act were limited to ten days; they were now extended
to fifteen days (Sundays excepted) if the business of the court
should so require. The third section of the act is in the
following words: "And be it further enacted that no attorney
shall be allowed to speak or be admitted as counsel in
the aforesaid court." The General Assembly must have entertained
a high opinion of the ability and purity of the
bench, and serious misgivings in relation to the cunning and
crafty bar of which John Haywood was the leader.</p>

<p>The late Judge Hall told me that he was present when
Joshua Williams, senator from Buncombe, called upon Governor
Turner for advice in relation to the extension of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
lease of life to this high tribunal. The Governor urged the
continuance of the court until the other offenders could be
arrested and tried, and the remaining questions of doubt and
difficulty in the law be put finally at rest. My good senator,
and there were few as good men as he in any age of the commonwealth,
assented, under the entire conviction that a little
longer time was necessary to enable the judges to render the
law so clear and certain, that no perplexing questions would
arise in the future. He was probably more confident of a
consummation so devoutly to be wished, since the court was
neither to be annoyed nor perplexed by the arguments of such
lawyers as Haywood.</p>

<p>Iredell, the greatest of Haywood's compeers was in his
grave. Moore was Iredell's successor on the Supreme Court
Bench of the United States, and Davie had on the 24th of
December, 1799, been appointed Envoy Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to the French
Republic as successor of Patrick Henry, who had been compelled
to decline on account of bodily infirmity.</p>

<p>In 1804, the court, which since 1801 had been styled the
Court of Conference, was made a court of record, the judges
required to reduce their opinions to writing, to file them "and
deliver the same <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> in open court." In the following
year (1805) the name was changed from the Court of Conference
to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and converted
from a temporary to a permanent, I hope immortal,
tribunal, in fame as in duration.</p>

<p>The senator from Buncombe, and the great advocate Haywood,
removed to Tennessee no great while afterwards. The
former lived long enough in the midst of the legal strife
which abounded in that young and rising commonwealth to
find that the end of controversy, like the end of the rainbow,
was not easily reached; and the latter to reap golden harvests
of fame and fortune from the "glorious uncertainty of
the common law."</p>

<p>When I first saw the Supreme Court in session in June,
1822, Chief Justice Taylor, the Mansfield of North Carolina
jurisprudence, Judge Hall, proverbial for integrity, amiability
and sound common sense, and Judge Henderson, who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
genius, judgment and power of fascination in social intercourse,
was without his peer, were the three judges. William
Drew, standing on the thin partition which divides great wit
and frenzy, was the Attorney-General. Francis L. Hawks,
who had not yet attained the 25th year of his age had already
given favorable promise of future eminence as a member of
the New Bern bar, the representative of that town in the
General Assembly, was the reporter. Hawks was destined
however to a much wider celebrity in a very different sphere,
and for many years previous to his death, as a brilliant writer
and eloquent speaker, had a higher transatlantic reputation
than any other American divine.</p>

<p>The bar in attendance in those days was much less numerous
than at present. He was a young man of rare self-complacency,
who would imperil a rising reputation in a contest
with the sages of the profession before that tribunal. I well
remember the remark of a gentleman, second as an advocate
in the Superior Courts to no one of his contemporaries, that
he never rose in the Supreme Court without trembling, and
never ventured to do more than simply to suggest the principles,
and give the names of the cases and authorities upon
which he relied.</p>

<p>Of those in attendance, Gaston, from the east, was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facile
princeps</i>, Archibald Henderson, probably the most eloquent
and successful advocate in criminal defenses who ever appeared
at the bar in North Carolina, was the great representative
of the middle, and Joseph Wilson of the extreme west, Judge
Murphy and Judge Ruffin represented Hillsborough, and
Judge Seawell, Gavin Hogg and Moses Mordecai, the Raleigh
circuit. Mr. Badger was just attaining the fulness of fame
while the youngest of the Superior Court judges, and Peter
Browne, the head of the bar, before Mr. Gaston assumed his
position, was deciding cases with unprecedented facility and
despatch as chairman of Wake County Court.</p>

<p>Mr. Devereux was the District Attorney for the United
States. James F. Taylor, with the most brilliant prospects,
died six years afterwards, Attorney-General of North Carolina
at the early age of 37.</p>

<p>With the present organization of the Supreme Court, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
January, 1819, commenced a gradual change in the length
of time consumed in the management of causes, in that and
the subordinate tribunals which continues to increase in an
accelerating ratio, and which ought to be diminished.</p>

<p>The Act of 1799, limited the sessions of the Court of Conference
to ten days, the Act of 1800 extended them to fifteen
days exclusive of Sundays. At one time, as we have seen,
no arguments were allowed, and throughout the entire existence
of the court discussions were of necessity commendably
brief.</p>

<p>Peter Browne, with an ample fortune and very high reputation,
relinquished his professional pursuits at the comparatively
early age of fifty-five. Selling the Lane residence, and
his well-selected library to his friend, Mr. Boylan, in the
summer of 1818, he returned to Scotland to spend the evening
of his life amidst the romantic scenes of his native
country. An absence of three years proved that the ties
which bound him to Raleigh were stronger than those which
bound him to his birthplace. He came back and resided
here until his death in November, 1832. In 1821, he
accepted the appointment of justice of the peace, and was
during several years chairman of Wake County Court.</p>

<p>I remember to have heard him complain of the dilatory
proceedings of the courts, and especially of the time lawyers
were permitted to consume in argument, as a grievous innovation
on ancient usages, and to asseverate most solemnly
that there was one court in North Carolina where no such
indulgence would be allowed. All who remember his administration,
will admit that few and brief were the arguments
heard in Wake County Court in his day.</p>

<p>My professional experience of ten years, eight at the bar,
and two upon the bench, closed in December 1832. During
this period I rode the Morganton, Hillsborough, Raleigh, and
Edenton Circuits, and met at intervals nearly every eminent
lawyer in the State. I can recall no instance when more
than a day was occupied with the trial of a cause.</p>

<p>Judge Cameron, the immediate successor of Mr. Browne
as president of the State Bank, was, during the last twenty
years of his life, a citizen of Raleigh. He came to the bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
at the age of twenty-one in 1798, was appointed judge in
February 1814, resigned December 1816, engaged immediately
in agricultural pursuits, and the performance of all
the duties which properly devolved on eminent citizens in
private life, and preeminent among these was the discharge
of the duties of presiding magistrate of the County Court of
Orange.</p>

<p>He had not attained his fortieth year when he retired from
the bench of the Superior Court.</p>

<p>During the fifteen years that he practiced law, his professional
emoluments were probably greater than fell to the
lot of any other North Carolina lawyer, at so early a period
of life, and to none were honors and emoluments more justly
awarded.</p>

<p>Mr. Badger, alike eminent as a jurist and a statesman, following
Mr. Browne, was, during a series of years chairman
in Wake; and Chief Justice Ruffin (a citizen of Raleigh from
1828 to 1834), simultaneously with Mr. Badger's services
here, was chairman of the County Court in Alamance.</p>

<p>Of the eminent lawyers who have appeared at our bar
during the present century, to no one living or dead has
greater length of days, crowned by more brilliant success in
all walks of life, been accorded, than to the four great men
who closed their professional career by the gratuitous, graceful,
able, and impartial discharge of the important duties
pertaining to the office of justice of the peace.</p>

<p>While I can make no positive averment, I am very confident
in the opinion that during the time that Judges Badger,
Cameron, and Ruffin presided on the Superior and County
Court bench, no case tried before them ever occupied more
than a single day.</p>

<p>Mr. Browne, as appears from the graveyard record, died at
the age of sixty-seven. Mr. Badger had entered upon his
seventy-second, and Judge Cameron his seventy-sixth year.
Chief Justice Ruffin, in the possession of unimpaired intellectual
strength, is an octogenarian.</p>

<p>In 1806, five years after the conviction of Glasgow, the
great case of Lord Granville's heirs <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> Governor Davie
and others, which threatened a more extensive confiscation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
than that menaced in our time, was argued before the Federal
Court in this city by Gaston and Harris for the plaintiffs,
and Cameron, Woods, and Baker for the State of North
Carolina. Potter, District Judge, charged the jury; Marshall,
Chief Justice, from personal considerations, peremptorily
declining to sit upon the trial.</p>

<p>Marshall is the only Revolutionary Titan I have ever seen.
With fair opportunities to judge of him as he appeared upon
the bench, and in social intercourse sixteen years afterwards,
I can pronounce with emphasis, that I never expect to look
upon his like again.</p>

<p>I sometimes feel apprehensive that I will become old myself
before a great while, when my memory recurs to the time
when Chief Justice Ruffin was one of the promising young
men of my day. In 1822, when a student in Chief Justice
Taylor's office, occupied by Mr. Gaston during the sessions
of the Federal and Supreme Courts, Ithiel Town, the architect
who planned the present capitol and who had an important
suit pending in the Federal Court against the Clarendon
Bridge Company, inquired of Mr. Gaston whether Mr. Ruffin
would be acceptable to him as associate counsel. He replied:
"No one more so; Mr. Ruffin is a very promising young
man, and if he lives ten years longer will be at the head of
the profession." The prediction was fully verified at an
earlier date.</p>

<p>Rarely since the completion of the Pentateuch has full
historic justice been meted out to woman. The character of
the great father of the human race is not more fully and
clearly delineated by Moses than that of its beautiful mother.
The termagant Sarah received quite as much attention as the
father of the faithful. Hagar is the heroine of an episode,
the most beautiful in the annals of history, with the single
exception of the narrative of the maternal tenderness of
Naomi, and the filial love and devotion of Ruth, the fascinating
little widow, whose charms dissolved the obdurate
celibacy of the sage, opulent and stately Boaz. The crafty
and managing Rebecca is finely contrasted with the confiding
Isaac; and the beautiful Rachel, from the moment that Jacob
gave his first kiss "and lifted up his voice and wept," as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
bride, and a mother with Joseph at her side in his little coat
of many colors and his stainless virtue, constitutes in life and
in death, the most charming picture on the historical canvas
of any age or country.</p>

<p>Why are not similar pictures presented in modern times?
Moses was inspired. Subjects are not wanting worthy of
historic inspiration. Has an abler monarch than Elizabeth, or
a more estimable sovereign than Victoria ever given character
and strength and grace to the British throne? Was "the
man of destiny" superior to Josephine? Is the Empress of
France inferior to Napoleon III.?</p>

<p>We are told that the heroic Wolfe while passing down the
St. Lawrence on his way to "glory and the grave," closed
the recitation of the inimitable "elegy" with the remark
that he would gladly exchange all the renown he had acquired
or hoped to achieve for the fame of the authorship of those
verses, and yet Gray makes no reference to the spot where
all the mothers of the hamlet sleep.</p>

<p>I have recently wandered through your cemetery, pausing
and lingering here and there, at the tombs of familiar acquaintances
and intimate friends, and realized the truth, that if
I could summon the departed around me, I would stand in
the midst of more numerous friends than I meet at the
present day in the crowded streets of your living city.</p>

<p>I trust I shall be suspected of no want of gallantry to the
living if I venture to intimate that among the nymphs that
illuminate the page of memory and imagination, I find pictures
of beauty and grace and refinement quite equal to the
best specimens of modern times, or even, in poetic hallucination,
"some brighter days than modern days, some fairer
maids than living maids."</p>

<p>Captain Peace reposes by the side of his aged brother without
as yet a stone to tell his name. He was, I suppose, at
the time of his death, the oldest citizen of Raleigh, as well
as the oldest man who has passed from the living city to the
city of the dead. I have never yet met with a man whom
I supposed to be a hundred years old. Various colored persons
have represented themselves of greater age, but their
computations would not bear scrutiny. The late William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Henry Haywood, the elder, died at the age of eighty-seven,
and Mrs. Haywood in her ninetieth year.</p>

<p>The honored name of their only son, the late Senator in
Congress, was given at the baptismal font to the senior proprietor
of Tucker Hall, in admiration of early promise, by a
discerning father. The suit of clothes presented to the child
by the Senator in acknowledgment of the compliment, is in
a state of perfect preservation, and will be kept as an interesting
illustration of the habits and customs of other days.
We are to be instructed by grave lecturers in every department
of science and art; shall we not have a miniature museum,
a portrait gallery and a niche for the preservation of
specimens of the antique, among which the best <em>bib</em> and
<em>tucker</em> of earlier times may find an appropriate place?</p>

<p>John Rex was one of the earliest citizens of Raleigh. My
acquaintance with him was slight. In appearance he was
said to bear striking resemblance to John Quincy Adams.
He was a grave, sedate, quiet, retiring, modest man, not
unlike in character to his worthy contemporary William
Peck. By long years of industry, economy and thrift in the
management of the first tannery established in Raleigh at
Rex's spring, near the railway station, he accumulated a handsome
estate, and like Mr. Peace, atoned for his failure to build
up a family, by a liberal provision for the children of misfortune
and want. He manumitted all his slaves at the close
of life, and bequeathed the remainder of his estate to the
endowment of a hospital, the construction of which is understood
to be in early prospect.</p>

<p>The Rex Hospital and Peace Institute, the latter far advanced
towards completion, will constitute the appropriate
and enduring monuments of these public benefactors. Mr.
Rex died January 29, 1839, aged seventy-four years.</p>

<p>As scant justice is done to the memory of the ladies who
repose in the cemetery, as is accorded to their sex on the page
of modern history. The memorials are few, and the information
given comparatively meagre.</p>

<p>Of the eighty-nine counties in North Carolina, nearly all
perpetuate the names of men. Two only, Wake and Jones,
are graced with the maiden names of women, the wives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Governor Tyron and Governor Nash. There are not less
significant indications of the want of liberality from the
sterner towards the gentler sex. Four-fifths of the wills that
I have had occasion to construe, give to the "dear wife" a
portion of the estate pared down to the narrowest limit that
the law will allow, "during life or widowhood." So universal
and inveterate is this phraseology, that a somewhat
famous parson in the county of Gates, some years ago at the
funeral of her husband, poured forth a most fervent supplication,
that the bereaved wife might "be blessed in her basket
and her store during life or widowhood."</p>

<p>I know but a single instance, the will of a distinguished
American statesman, Gouverneur Morris, which provides a
largely increased annuity to the widow in case of a second
marriage.</p>

<p>Jacob Marling was the first portrait and landscape painter,
and various specimens of his art are now extant, among others
a picture of the State-house as it was anterior to the fire of
1831. It graces the parlor of Dr. F. J. Haywood.</p>

<p>The following narrative of the celebration of the thirty-third
anniversary of American Independence, is from the pen
of General Calvin Jones, one of the most useful men of his
day. A careful examination of all the details will present
to the mind a more life-like picture of what your city was
in all the aspects of society in 1809 than can possibly be
produced by the most elaborate attempt at description by a
modern pen. Compare and contrast it with the scenes exhibited
and the events which occurred on an anniversary
fifty-eight years thereafter, and in due time make suitable
preparation for the proper observance of a day still dear to
every patriotic bosom.</p>

<p>"The thirty-third anniversary of American Independence
was celebrated in this city in the usual manner on the 4th
inst. At 12 o'clock a procession of citizens and strangers,
with Captain Willie Jones' troop of cavalry at the head,
formed at the court-house, agreeable to previous arrangements,
and directed by Captain Scott, proceeded up Fayetteville
street to the State-house, during the ringing of the
State-house, court-house, academy and town bells, and firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of cannon. Being seated in the Commons' Chamber,
an ode in honor of that day, composed for the occasion, was
sung by a choir of about seventy voices, conducted by Mr.
Seward, accompanied by a band of instrumental music.</p>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. Turner then rose and delivered an oration
on the merits of which we shall at present forbear to speak
as we intend to solicit a copy for publication, and hope in our
next to present it as a very acceptable treat to our readers.
At the conclusion another patriotic ode was sung.</p>

<p>"At 3 o'clock the company sat down to an excellent dinner
prepared by Mr. Casso at the State-house, at which Colonel
Polk and Judge Potter presided. Seventeen appropriate
toasts were drunk, among which we notice the following:
'The President of the United States, may his administration
close as it has commenced, with the applause and general
approbation of the people.'</p>

<p>"'George Washington, the hero, patriot, statesman, friend
and father of his country, the memory of his inestimable
worth and service will never cease to be revered by the
American people.'</p>

<p>"'Literature, the arts and sciences, the precursors of
national greatness and universal happiness.'</p>

<p>"'The University of North Carolina, may the people see
and fully understand the great interest they have in this institution,
and before it is too late duly foster and endow it.'</p>

<p>"'The Constitution of North Carolina, the happy, wise
and revered work of our ancestors, long may it remain sacred
and inviolate.'</p>

<p>"'The social circles of life, may no discordant interests or
variant opinions be suffered to destroy their harmony.'</p>

<p>"The Supreme Court of the State being in session, the
celebration was honored with the presence of the judges,
gentlemen of the bar and many other characters of respectability
from almost every part of the State.</p>

<p>"In the evening a ball was given to the ladies."</p>

<p>Of all the joyous throng that crowded these streets at that
national jubilee fifty-eight years ago, whose bosoms thrilled
responsive to the patriotic sentiments of the orator of the day,
or who gathered round the festive board&mdash;of all the gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
men and beautiful women who united in the exultant song or
chased the flying hours in that evening's dance, there is probably
not one present now, not one to contrast the spectacle
then presented of a great, free, united, and happy people, with
their discordant, dissevered relations in 1867!</p>

<p>I heard Governor Vance deliver his address on Swain,
which I have called a sketch, at the Chapel Hill Commencement
of 1877. I well remember the low melancholy and the
effortless pathos of his voice.</p>

<p>Governor Swain was his friend, and fortunate is he indeed
to have had such a kind and able hand to sketch his life.</p>

<p>The foregoing estimate of Swain's character and methods
does not receive the unanimous endorsement of all who knew
him. He was thought by some to have been guilty of
favoritism, to have lacked nerve for discipline, and to have
shown too great partiality for families of wealth and influence.
But he rendered a service to the State in writing and preserving
some memorials of her history. He held the most
important position she could bestow for many years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
until his death; and his regime illustrated the defects of a
system which prevented the University from being directly
and entirely dependent on the people for its support.</p>

<p>Vance put him among the distinguished men of North
Carolina, and for this, if for no other reason, I could afford to
put him in this book. Posterity will not lightly overrule the
verdict of its greatest commoner, even though rendered in
the partiality of affection.</p>

<p>Although no sketch of Vance is in this book (his life, in a
more extended form, having been lately written), yet Bryan's
estimate of him, spoken in the House of Representatives, February
25, 1895, is not an inappropriate introduction of the
man who has contributed to history the foregoing sketch of
Swain&mdash;if indeed there be any part of the Union where he
needs an introduction, even from the lips of one who has
canvassed the whole country. Besides, it would be offensive
to North Carolinians if I should even begin a list of our distinguished
dead without according to Vance his well-won
place among the foremost.</p>

<h3>W. J. BRYAN'S ESTIMATE OF VANCE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Speaker</span>: We are called upon on these occasions to
speak of the virtues of many different types of men. Sometimes
one is taken from us who has spent the most of his days
in private business and has come to these halls to crown with
public honors a busy life. Sometimes we are called to mourn
a man taken from us in the very beginning of his career, and
consider what he might have accomplished had he lived. But
it is seldom that, in either of these halls, we find a man whose
life was so completely given to public service as was the life
of Senator Vance. He began his public career when a young
man barely of age, and he has been a public servant from
that time, almost without pause, until his earthly life was
ended. In the history of our country I think we shall find
few men as remarkable. When a man is elected once or twice
and disappears, we may attribute his success to circumstances;
but when he begins, as Mr. Vance began, a young man, and
retains the confidence of those whom he served for a generation,
we must conclude that his success is due to something
more than a chance or accident.</p>

<p>Senator Vance was a "leader among men." Few in our
day, or in our history even, have better earned that distinction.
He was a leader among men&mdash;and naturally so. He
had those characteristics which could not fail to make him a
leader, not self-appointed, but chosen by common consent.
He was a wise man. He was able to estimate causes and calculate
effects. He was able to foresee what would come to
pass, because he understood men&mdash;that is necessary in a leader.
We rely upon the Infinite because we are finite. We feel the
limitations of our own knowledge, and we long to find some
one who knows more and can see further than we. Among
men, we naturally turn to the one who can foresee events,
as a child turns to a parent for advice. It was not the experience
of age which he possessed, it was a sort of intuitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
judgment, an instinct for truth, that made him see in advance
what others only found out afterwards.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned here to-day that when the late civil
war was about to break out he was able to survey the whole
ground and see what would be the necessary result, and that
he told his people what that result would be. He did this,
too, when a young man&mdash;younger than any of us who are on
this floor to-day&mdash;and time proved his wisdom. So, coming
on down, as each new crisis arose, as each new force began its
work upon society, he seemed to be able to calculate what was
coming, and every time his judgment was justified by events
his hold upon popular confidence increased.</p>

<p>When the Fifty-third Congress was convened in extra session
in August, 1893, no man in this country more clearly
foresaw the course of events and more clearly predicted the
results of the proposed financial policy. He talked with his
associates; he wrote to his people, he told them just what the
effect would be upon the party with which he was identified,
and whose name he loved.</p>

<p>Not only was he wise, but he was courageous. And courage
is a characteristic, too, in a leader of men. He had the
courage to assume responsibility. He shirked no duty. What
he believed he said, and he was willing to stand or fall by
the correctness of his conclusions. Jefferson, in speaking of
some man, said that he had not learned the sublime truth that
a bold, unequivocal virtue is the best handmaid even unto
ambition. Zebulon B. Vance had learned that sublime truth.
He knew, while trimming one's sails to catch a passing breeze
may help temporarily, there is nothing which is permanently
of aid to a public man except standing by his convictions.
I have no doubt he had ambition; but from what I have been
able to read and learn of him, it was a laudable ambition
which every man in this country may well possess, an ambition
to do his duty everywhere, an ambition to deserve well,
to have what he deserved and nothing more.</p>

<p>He had more than wisdom and courage; he had that without
which wisdom and courage would have boon of no avail:
he loved the people whom he would lead. And it was no
condescending love either. It was no stooping down to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
one beneath him. He really believed in the equality of men,
and that those among whom he associated were his brethren.
He shared their hopes, their aims, and their ambitions. He
felt their woes and he knew their joys. He was one of them,
and the people loved him because they knew that he loved
them. They trusted him because they knew that he trusted
them. In building upon the affections of the people he built
upon the only sure foundation.</p>

<p>It has been said that the most sincere tribute that can be
paid to a man is that which is paid at his grave. Some may
fear him while he lives, and therefore show him attention;
or others may desire to court his favor. When we see apparent
friendship for the great we do not always know what
motives may be behind it. But when a man is dead and is
impotent longer to injure or to aid, when men gather round
his grave and manifest their love, then we know that their
affection is disinterested. And I believe it can be said that
no man in this country ever enjoyed the sincere affection of
a larger proportion of the people whom he served than Mr.
Vance.</p>

<p>But he was not only a leader of men, he was an orator of
great influence. Not that, on dress parade, he was the best
man to put up for a public speech, but he was one of the
great orators because he possessed two of the characteristics
of the orator; he knew what he was talking about when he
talked, and he believed what he said. He who believes what
he says will move others; and he who knows what he is talking
about will convince others. Not only did he impart
knowledge surcharged with earnestness, but he possessed rare
ability in making the truth pleasant to receive.</p>

<p>He was a statesman as well as a leader of men and an
orator. As a statesman he was devoted to his work and was
prepared to make every sacrifice for which his position called.
As a statesman he was ready to give to every call that conscientious
response which duty required. As a statesman he
was pecuniarily honest. There is nothing in the life of Mr.
Vance that I prize more than the fact that with all his ability,
with all his knowledge, with all his influence, no person can
say that he ever sold his influence, his ability, or his support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
for money. No person can say that on any occasion he
ever surrendered the interests of the people, as he understood
those interests, for hope of gain.</p>

<p>Sometimes people speak sneeringly of legislators. Sometimes
they speak as if there were no such thing as honesty
among them. Some people talk as if every man has his
price, as if all that is necessary is to offer enough money, and
the influence of any man who is serving in official position
can be purchased. I do not believe that the worst enemy
that Mr. Vance ever had would say of him that any amount
of money, however great, could have purchased his vote, his
voice or his influence. And that a man with his commanding
ability, whose official life began at the very dawn of manhood,
and continued through all the conspicuous positions
within the gift of his countrymen, should successfully resist
all pecuniary temptation and die poor, is, I think, one of the
proudest of his achievements.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are things in this life more valuable
than money. The wise man said three thousand years ago,
"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
loving favor than silver and gold." We struggle, we sacrifice,
and we toil in order to leave to our children a fortune;
but I believe that Senator Vance has left to his widow, and
to his children a greater, a more valuable heritage than could
possibly have been left had he given to them all the money
which one man ever accumulated in this world. When he
left to them a name untarnished, when he left to them a reputation
such as he earned and bore, he left to them that which
no wealth can purchase. I am not skilled in the use of
obituary adjectives, and did not rise to give a review of his
life, but I beg to place on record my tribute of profound
respect for a public servant who at the close of his career was
able to say to the people for whom he toiled, "I have lived
in your presence for a lifetime; I have received all my honors
at your hands; I stand before you without fear that any one
can charge against me an official wrong." I say, to such a
man I pay my tribute of respect.</p>

<p>The patriotic people of the county of Rockingham, in a
public assemblage at their first Superior Court after the death
of Chief Justice Ruffin, in which they were joined with
cordial sympathy by the gentlemen of the bar at that court,
resolved to manifest their appreciation of his talents, virtues
and public usefulness, by causing to be pronounced a memorial
on his life and character. Such an offering was
deemed by them a fitting tribute from a people among whom
his family first settled, upon their arrival in North Carolina,
and with whom he had been associated as a planter and cultivator
of the soil from his early manhood till his decease. The
Agricultural Society of the State, of which for many years
he had been a distinguished president, subsequently determined
on a like offering to his memory at their annual fair.
The invitation to prepare such a discourse has been by both
bodies extended to the same individual. The task is undertaken
with diffidence and a sense of apprehension that amid
the multiplicity of other engagements its fulfillment may
fail in doing justice to the subject of this memoir.</p>

<p>Thomas Ruffin, the eldest child of his parents, was born
at Newington, the residence of his maternal grandfather,
Thomas Roane, in the county of King and Queen, in Virginia,
on the 17th of November, 1787.</p>

<p>His father, Sterling Ruffin, Esquire, was a planter in the
neighboring county of Essex, who subsequently transferred
his residence to North Carolina, and died in the county of
Caswell. Ardent in his religious sentiments, and long
attached to the Methodist Episcopal Church, he very late in
life entered the ministry, and was for a few years prior to his
death a preacher in that denomination.</p>

<p>His mother, Alice Roane, was of a family much distinguished
in Virginia by the public service of many of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
members, and was herself first cousin of Spencer Roane, the
Chief Justice of that State, in the past generation, whose
judicial course, connected as it was with questions of difficulty
and importance in constitutional law, gave him high
professional, as well as political, distinction; but it may well
be doubted whether, in all that constitutes a great lawyer,
he had preeminence over the subject of our present sketch,
his junior kinsman in North Carolina, then but rising into
fame, and destined to fill the like office in his own State.</p>

<p>His father, though not affluent, had a respectable fortune,
and sought for the son the best means of education. His
early boyhood was passed on the farm in Essex, and in attendance
on the schools of the vicinity. Thence, at a suitable
age, he was sent to a classical academy in the beautiful and
healthful village of Warrenton, in North Carolina, then under
the management of Mr. Marcus George, an Irishman by birth
and education, a fine classical scholar and most painstaking
and skillful instructor, especially in elocution, as we must
believe, since among his pupils who survived to our times we
found the best readers of their day, within our acquaintance.
His excellence in this particular was probably attributable to
his experience on the theatrical stage, where he had spent a
portion of his life. He made his first appearance in the State
at Hillsborough, during the Convention of 1788, which rejected
the Federal Constitution, and being in search of employment
as a teacher, he was engaged by the Warren gentlemen
then in attendance, and many years subsequently was
still at the head of a flourishing school, in which our student
entered. The system and discipline of Mr. George conformed
to the ancient regime, and placed great faith in the rod; and
he being a man of much personal prowess and spirit, did not
scruple to administer it on his pupils, when sloth, delinquency
or misbehavior required, without regard to age, size or other
circumstances. Yet he secured the respect of his patrons
and the confidence of the public, and inspired the gratitude
and affection of his pupils in a remarkable degree.</p>

<p>This turning aside from our subject, to pay a passing tribute
to his old preceptor, is deemed to be justified not only by the
long and useful labors of Mr. George, in the instruction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
youth in the generation in which Mr. Ruffin's lot was cast,
but because he himself entertained the highest appreciation
of the profession of an instructor, accustoming himself to
speak of it as one of the most honorable and beneficent of
human employments. Throughout his laborious and well-spent
life he often acknowledged his obligations of gratitude
for the early training he had received under the tuition of
this faithful, but somewhat eccentric, son of Erin. And it
may well be doubted whether Lord Eldon, in the maturity
of his wisdom and great age, retained a more grateful and
affectionate recollection of Master Moises of the High School
of New Castle, than did Chief Justice Ruffin of Master
George of the Warrenton Male Academy.</p>

<p>At this institution were assembled the sons of most of the
citizens of eastern North Carolina, and of the bordering counties
of Virginia, who aspired to a liberal education. And here
were formed friendships which he cherished with great satisfaction
throughout life. Among his companions were the
late Robert Broadnax, of Rockingham, subsequently a planter
of large possessions on Dan River, among the most estimable
gentlemen of his time; and Cadwallader Jones, then of Halifax,
but afterwards of Orange, an officer at different periods
in the navy and in the army of the United States, a successful
planter, and a model of the manners and virtues which give
a charm to social intercourse. Here, too, he found Weldon
N. Edwards, of Warren, subsequently distinguished by much
public service in Congress and under the government of the
State, thenceforward his lifelong friend, with whom the
bonds of amity seemed to be drawn more closely as others
of his contemporaries dropped from around him. Of these
four youths of the Warrenton Academy, in the beginning
of the nineteenth century, Mr. Edwards alone survives.
Long may he live to enjoy the veneration and respect due to
a life of probity, honor, and usefulness.</p>

<p>From the Warrenton Academy young Ruffin was transferred
to the College of Nassau Hall, at Princeton, New Jersey.
It is believed that his father, who was a deeply pious
man, was controlled in the selection of this college in preference
to that of William and Mary, in Virginia (next to Harvard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
University the oldest institution of learning in the
United States), not only by a desire to guard his son's health,
which had suffered from the malaria of tide-water Virginia,
but to secure him as well against the temptations incident to
college life in an institution where, as he supposed, the discipline
was too lax for the sons of affluence who matriculated
there. He entered the freshman class at Princeton, and
graduated at the commencement in 1805, the sixteenth in a
class of forty-two members, "being the first of the second
division of intermediate honors." The late Governor James
Iredell, of North Carolina, was in the class succeeding his
own, and for nearly the whole of his college course his room-mate.
Thus commenced a friendship between these gentlemen
in youth which was terminated only by the death of Mr.
Iredell. Among others of his college associates who became
distinguished in subsequent life, there were Samuel L. Southard
and Theodore Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, Joseph R.
Ingersoll, of Philadelphia, the Cuthberts and Habershams, of
Georgia, Christopher Hughes of Maryland, and Stephenson
Archer, of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Returning home with his bachelor degree, Mr. Ruffin soon
afterwards entered the law office of David Robertson, Esq.,
of Petersburg, as a student of law, and continued there
through the years 1806 and 1807. Here he was associated
as a fellow-student with John F. May, afterwards Judge May,
of Petersburg, and Winfield Scott, afterwards so highly distinguished
in arms, and the only officer, down to his time,
except General Washington, who attained the rank of Lieutenant-General
in the army of the United States. General
Scott, in his autobiography, describes their preceptor, Mr.
Robertson, as a Scotchman, a very learned scholar and barrister,
who originally came to America as a classical teacher,
but subsequently gained high distinction as a lawyer, and was
the author of the report of the debates in the Virginia Convention
which adopted the Federal Constitution, and of the
report of the trial of Aaron Burr for high treason. In a
note to the same work, General Scott mentions his chancing
to meet Judge Ruffin in New York in 1853, while the latter
was attending as a delegate the Protestant Episcopal Convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of the United States, after a separation of forty-seven
years, and recurs to their association together with Judge
May, as law students, and to the conversation in which they
then indulged, with manifest pride and pleasure. He also
refers to their subsequent intercourse in the City of Washington,
in 1861, while Judge Ruffin was serving as a member of
the Peace Congress, and expresses the opinion that if the
sentiments of this good man, always highly conservative (the
same as Crittenden's), had prevailed, the country would have
escaped the sad infliction of the war, which was raging at the
time he wrote.</p>

<p>Sterling Ruffin, the father, having suffered some reverses
of fortune, determined to change his home, and removed to
Rockingham county, North Carolina, in 1807. His son soon
followed, a willing emigrant. It was in North Carolina he
had received his first training for useful life: here was the
home of most of his early friends, and here he confidently
hoped to renew his associations with Broadnax, Jones, Edwards,
Iredell, and other kindred spirits.</p>

<p>He doubtless brought with him a considerable store of
professional learning from the office of Mr. Robertson, in
which he had been more than two years a student, but on his
arrival in North Carolina he pursued his further studies under
the direction of Hon. A. D. Murphy, until his admission to
the bar, in 1808. Early in 1809, he established his home in
the town of Hillsborough, and on the 9th of December in
that year he was united in marriage to Miss Ann Kirkland,
eldest daughter of the late William Kirkland, of that place,
a prominent merchant and leading citizen.</p>

<p>The twenty years next ensuing, during which his residence
was continually in Hillsborough, comprehends his career at
the bar and on the bench of the Superior Courts. In 1813,
1815 and 1816 he served as a member of the Legislature in
the House of Commons from this town, under the old Constitution
and filled the office of Speaker of the House at the
last mentioned session, when first elected a judge, upon the
resignation of Duncan Cameron. He was also a candidate
on the electoral ticket in favor of William H. Crawford for the
Presidency of the United States in 1824. But his aspirations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
tastes, and interests inclined him not to political honors, but
to a steady adherence to the profession to which his life was
devoted. He found at the bar in Orange and the neighboring
counties several gentlemen, his seniors in years, who were
no ordinary competitors for forensic fame and patronage, of
whom it may be sufficient to name Archibald D. Murphy,
Frederick Nash, William Norwood, Duncan Cameron, Henry
Seawell, Leonard Henderson, William Robards, Nicholas P.
Smith, of Chatham, and later of Tennessee. His first essays
in argument are said not to have been very fortunate. His
manner was diffident and his speech hesitating and embarrassed.
But these difficulties being soon overcome, the vigor
of his understanding, the extent and accuracy of his learning,
and the perfect mastery of his causes by diligent preparation,
in a short time gave him position among these veterans of the
profession, secured him a general and lucrative practice, and
an easy accession to the bench in seven years from his initiation
at the bar.</p>

<p>His reputation was greatly advanced and extended by the
manner in which he acquitted himself in this office. The
wants, however, of an increasing family and an unfortunate
involvement by suretyship forbade his continuance in a situation
of no better income than the salary which was its compensation.
He resigned to the Legislature of 1818, and immediately
returned to the practice. Mr. Ruffin had kept up
habits of close study of his profession before his promotion
to the bench, and he eagerly availed himself of the leisure
afforded by the vacations of the office for the same object.
He came back to the bar not only with his health renovated,
which had never been very robust, but with a brightness in
his learning and an increase of fame which, in the Supreme
Court, then recently established on its present basis, and in
the Circuit Court of the United States, as well as on the ridings
in the State courts, brought to him a practice and an
income which has hardly ever been equaled by any other
practitioner in North Carolina. For forty-three weeks in
the year he had engagements in court, and despite all conditions
of the weather or other impediments to traveling in
the then state of the country, rarely failed to fulfill them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
held the appointment of Reporter of the decisions of the
Supreme Court for one or two terms, but relinquished it on
account of the engrossment of his time by his practice; and
his labors are embraced in the first volume of Hawks. Mr.
Archibald Henderson, Mr. Gaston, Mr. Seawell, Mr. Murphy,
Mr. Moses Mordecai, Mr. Gavin Hogg, and Mr. Joseph Wilson,
all men of renown, were, with Mr. Ruffin, the chief advocates
in the Supreme Court at that period, Mr. Nash and Mr.
Badger being then upon the bench; and according to tradition,
at no time have the arguments before it been more thorough
and exhaustive. The late Governor Swain being, part
of this period, a student of the law in the office of Chief Justice
Taylor, in a public address at the opening of Tucker Hall,
mentions a prediction in his hearing by Mr. Gaston to one of
his clients in 1822, that if Mr. Ruffin should live ten years
longer he would be at the head of the profession in North
Carolina. By the same authority we are informed that only
a year or two later Judge Henderson declared that he had
then attained this position of eminence.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1825, upon the resignation of Judge
Badger, Mr. Ruffin again accepted the appointment of Judge
of the Superior Courts. His recent successes had relieved
him of embarrassment, and supplied him a competent fortune;
his health demanded relaxation and rest; and he considered
his duties to his family, now quite numerous, required
more of his presence at home than was consistent with the
very active life he was leading. He therefore relinquished
his great emoluments at the bar for the inadequate salary
then paid to a judge, and virtually closed his career as an
advocate. By the bar and the public he was welcomed back
on the circuits, and for the three following years he administered
the law with such universal approbation that it was
generally understood he would be appointed to the bench of
the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The reputation he had established by this time, however,
did not merely assign him capabilities as a lawyer, but
ascribed to him every qualification of a thorough man of
affairs. It was conceded, at least, that he could teach bankers
banking and merchants the science of accounts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1828 the stockholders of the old State
Bank of North Carolina, at the head of whom were William
Polk, Peter Browne, and Duncan Cameron, owing to the
great embarrassment of the affairs of the institution, involving
disfavor with the public and threats of judicial proceedings
for a forfeiture of its charter, prevailed on him to take
the presidency of the bank, with a salary increased to the
procurement of his acceptance, and with the privilege on
his part to practise his profession in the city of Raleigh. In
twelve months, with characteristic energy, mastering the
affairs of the bank with a true talent for finance, making
available its assets and providing for its liabilities, and inspiring
confidence by the general faith in his abilities and high
purpose to do right, he effectually redeemed the institution,
and prepared the way to close out in credit the remaining
term of its charter.</p>

<p>At this period, also, another place of high political eminence
was at his choice, but was promptly declined. A vacancy
having happened in the Senate of the United States by
the appointment of Governor Branch to the head of the Navy
Department, and Hon. Bartlett Yancey, who had been the
general favorite for the succession, having recently died, Mr.
Ruffin was earnestly solicited to accept a candidacy for this
position, with every assurance of success. But his desire was,
as he himself expressed it among his friends, after the
labor and attention he had bestowed upon his profession, to
go down to posterity as a lawyer. Irrespective, therefore,
of his domestic interests, and the care and attention due to
his family, of which no man ever had a truer or warmer conception,
he could not be diverted from his chosen line of life
by the attractions of even the highest political distinction.</p>

<p>While assiduously employed in the affairs of the bank, to
which was devoted the year 1829, his services were still demanded
by clients in the higher courts, and his reputation
at the bar suffered no eclipse. Upon the death of Chief
Justice Taylor, in this year, the executive appointment of a
successor was conferred on a gentleman of merited eminence
in the profession, and of a singularly pure and elevated character;
but the sentiment of the majority of the profession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
as well as public opinion, had made choice of Mr. Ruffin for
the permanent office, and he was elected a Judge of the Supreme
Court at the session of the Legislature in the autumn of
1829. In 1833, upon the demise of Chief Justice Henderson,
he was elevated to the Chief Justiceship, in which he won
that fame which will longest endure because it is incorporated
in the judicial literature of the country, and is coextensive
with the study and administration of our system of law.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Ruffin's arguments at the bar no memorials have
been preserved save the imperfect briefs contained in the
causes that have been reported. His nature was ardent, his
manner of speech earnest and often vehement in tone and
gesticulation. Though versed in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, and with
tastes to relish eloquent declamation, it was a field into which
he did not often, if at all, adventure. His reliance was upon
logic; not upon rhetoric; and even his illustrations were
drawn from things practical rather than ideal. Analyzing
and thoroughly comprehending his cause, he held it up plainly
to the view of others, and with a searching incisive criticism
exposed and dissipated the weak points in that of his adversary;
and all this in a vigorous, terse and manly English, every
word of which told. Few advocates ever equaled him in presenting
so much of solid thought in the same number of words,
or in disentangling complicated facts or elucidating abstruse
learning so as to make the demonstration complete to the
minds of his hearers. These capacities he doubtless gained
by severe culture, a part of which, as I learned from an early
student in his office, resulted from his daily habit of going
carefully over the demonstration of a theorem in mathematics.
Thus habituated to abstract and exact reasoning, he
delighted in the approach to exactness in the reasoning of the
law, and no student could more truly say of his professional
investigations: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Labor ipse est voluptas</i>. The accuracy thus
attained in his studies gave him great eminence as a pleader
in causes both at law and in equity; and the office of framing
the pleadings was usually conceded to him by his colleagues
in the causes in which they were associated. It also gave
him rank among the great counsellors of the time whose
opinions were not the result of cramming for an occasion, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
a fortunate authority, but the well considered reflections of
gifted minds imbued with law as a science. The full development
of his forensic character does not appear to have been
manifested until after his return to the bar subsequently to
his first service on the bench. But from this period till his
second retirement, in 1825, he had hardly a rival in the bar of
the Supreme Court of the State or the Circuit Court of the
United States, except Archibald Henderson and Gaston, and
he had a command of the practice in all the State courts he
attended. As a Judge of the Superior Courts he exhibited
equal aptitude as for the practice at the bar. With an energy
that pressed the business forward, a quickness rarely equaled
in perceiving and comprehending facts, patient and industrious
habits of labor, and a spirit of command which suffered
no time to be lost, he dispatched causes with expedition, but
with no indecent haste. Whilst he presided it was rare that
any cause before a jury ever occupied more than a single day,
and none is remembered that extended beyond two. He dismissed
a suit brought to test a wager at the cost of both
parties, and remarked that it was on account of leniency that
he did not imprison them.</p>

<p>In administering the criminal law, in which the extent of
punishment generally depended on the discretion of the judge,
his sentences were such as to inspire evil-doers with terror,
but eminently tended to give protection to society and confidence
to honest and law-abiding men.</p>

<p>His accession to the bench of the Supreme Court was a
source of general satisfaction to the profession, and to the
people of the State, by whom his enlightened labors in the
circuits had been witnessed with admiration and pride. He
at once took a conspicuous part in the proceedings of this
high tribunal, and for the twenty-three years that he continuously
sat there, probably delivered a greater number of
the opinions than any judge with whom, in all this long
career, he was associated. These opinions are found through
more than twenty-five volumes of the Reports, and form the
bulk of our judicial literature for a full generation. They
have been cited with approbation in the American courts,
State and national, by eminent legal authors, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
judicial deliberations of Westminster Hall; and the North
Carolina lawyer who can invoke one of them as a case in point
with his own generally considers that he is possessed of an
impenetrable shield. It has been rare in England that a judge
or advocate has reached high distinction in the courts both
of common law and equity. The student of the judicial arguments
of Chief Justice Ruffin will be at a loss to determine
in which of these branches of legal science he most excelled.
To the votary of the common law, fresh from the perusal of
the black letter of the times of the Tudors and early Stuarts,
and captivated with its artificial refinements and technical
distinctions, he would appear to have pursued his professional
education upon the intimation of Butler, in his reminiscences,
that "he is the best lawyer, and will succeed best in his profession,
who best understands Coke upon Littleton"; or, advancing
to the modern ages of greater enlightenment and
freer intercourse among nations, that he had made a specialty
of the law of contracts, bills of exchange and commercial law
generally; whilst his expositions of equity causes will satisfy
any impartial critic that he was at least equally a proficient
and master of the principles and practice of the jurisprudence
of the English Chancery, and would induce the belief that,
like Sir Samuel Romilly or Sir William Grant, his practice at
the bar had been confined to this branch of the profession.</p>

<p>During his chief-justiceship it cannot fail to be remarked
that there was a great advance in the accuracy of pleadings
in equity cases, and in general extension of the knowledge of
equity practice throughout the circuits. And the precision
and propriety of entries in every species of procedure were
brought to a high state of perfection, mainly by his investigations
and labors, in conjunction with those of that most
worthy gentleman, and modest but able lawyer, Edmund B.
Freeman, Esq., late Clerk of the Supreme Court, whose virtues
and public usefulness, connected as he was for so many
years in close and friendly association with the immediate
subject of our remarks, now likewise gone down beyond the
horizon, I am gratified the opportunity serves to commemorate.</p>

<p>Judge Ruffin's conversancy with political ethics, public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
law, and English and American history seems to have assigned
to him the task of delivering the opinions on constitutional
questions which have attracted most general attention. That
delivered by him in the case of <i>Hoke</i> vs. <i>Henderson</i>, in which
it was held that the Legislature could not, by a sentence of its
own in the form of an enactment, divest a citizen of property,
even in a public office, because the proceeding was an exercise
of judicial power, received the high encomium of Kent and
other authors on constitutional law; and I happened personally
to witness that it was the main authority relied on by Mr.
Reverdy Johnson, in the argument for the second time in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex parte Garland</i>, which involved the power of Congress, by
a test oath, to exclude lawyers from the practice in the Supreme
Court of the United States for having participated in
civil war against the government; and in which, its reasoning
on the negative side of the question, was sustained by that
august tribunal.</p>

<p>The singular felicity and aptitude with which he denuded
his judgments of all extraneous matter, and expounded the
principles of the case in hand, usually citing authority only
to uphold what had been demonstrated without it, is the most
striking feature of his numerous opinions. His style of writing
was elevated and worthy of the themes he discussed. His
language was well selected, and exhibited a critical acquaintance
with English philology. A marked characteristic in
his writings, as it was also in his conversation, was the frequent,
dextrous, and strikingly appropriate use he made of
the brief words of our language, usually of Saxon derivation.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1852, while in the zenith of his reputation,
and not yet pressed with the weight of years, Chief Justice
Ruffin resigned his office and retired, as he supposed forever,
from the professional employments he had so long and
with so much renown pursued. But on the death of his successor
and friend, Chief Justice Nash, in December, 1858,
he was called by the almost unanimous vote of the General
Assembly, then in session, to fill the vacancy, and sat again
as a Judge of the Supreme Court until the autumn of 1859,
when failing health rendered his labors irksome, and he took
his final leave of judicial life. Six years of rest in his rural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
home had induced nothing of rust or desuetude: he wore the
ermine as naturally and gracefully as if he had never been
divested of its folds; his judicial arguments at this time evince
all that vigor of thought and freshness and copiousness of
learning which had prompted an old admirer to say of him
that he was a "born lawyer." It is not improbable that this
preservation in full panoply was, in some degree, aided by the
circumstance that in a desire to be useful in any sphere for
which he was fitted, he had accepted the office of a justice of
the peace in the county of Alamance, in which he then resided,
and had held the County Courts with the lay justices during
this period. Though near ten years later, and when he had
passed the age of eighty, in a matter of seizure, under the revenue
laws, in which he took some interest for a friend, in the
Circuit Court of the United States, a branch of practice to
which he had not been habituated by experience, I had occasion
to observe that he was as ready with his pen in framing
the pleadings, without books of authority or precedent, as
any proctor in a court of admiralty.</p>

<p>At an early period he became the proprietor of an estate
on Dan River, in Rockingham, on which he established a
plantation at once, and gave personal direction to its profitable
cultivation from that time until near the time of his death.
Carrying his family to Raleigh for a sojourn of twelve
months, upon assuming the presidency of a bank, as already
stated, he removed thence to Haw River, in Alamance, in
1830, and there, under his own eye, carried on the operations
of a planter with success until the year 1866, when the results
of the war deprived him of laborers and he sold the estate and
removed again to Hillsborough. The law has been said by
some of its old authors to be a jealous mistress, and to allow
no rival in the attentions of its votary. Chief Justice Ruffin,
however, while diligently performing the duties of his great
office, and keeping up with the labors of his contemporaries,
Lyndhurst, Brougham, Tenterden, and Denman, in England,
and the numerous courts exercising like jurisdictions in
America, found leisure to manage his farm at home as well
as to give direction to that in Rockingham. And this, not in
the ineffective manner which has attended like efforts of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
professional men, but with present profit and improvement of
the estates. From early life he appeared to have conceived
a fondness for agriculture, including horticulture and
the growing of fruit-trees and flowers, which his home in the
country seemed to have been selected to indulge. Here, for
thirty-five years during the recesses of his courts, he found
recreation in these pursuits and in the rearing of domestic
animals; the result of which was the most encouraging success
in orchards, grapery, garden, cereals, flocks and herds.
Combining a knowledge of the general principles of science,
with fine powers of observation, and the suggestions of the
most approved agricultural periodicals, he was prepared to
avail himself in practice of the highest intelligence in the art.
It was therefore no empty compliment to a great jurist and
leading citizen when the Agricultural Society of North Carolina,
in 1854, elected him to its presidency after his retirement
from the bench. He was continued in this distinguished
position for six years, when declining health demanded
his retirement; and at no time have the interests of
the Society been more prosperous, its public exhibitions more
spirited; and it may be added that on no occasion did he ever
manifest more satisfaction than in the reunions of its members.</p>

<p>The liberal hospitality that he dispensed throughout life
was a most conspicuous feature in the period thus devoted
to practical agriculture. His nature was eminently social, his
acquaintance in his high position extensive, his dwelling near
one of the great highways of travel through the State in the
old modes of conveyance, easy of access, and the exuberance
of his farm, garden, orchards and domestic comforts were
never more agreeably dispensed than when ministered to the
gratification of his friends under his own roof.</p>

<p>The cordiality and ease with which he did the honors of an
entertainer in an old-fashioned Southern mansion is among
the pleasant recollections of not a few between the Potomac
and the Mississippi. It was here, indeed, surrounded by a
family worthy of the care and affection he bestowed upon
them, relaxed from the severe studies and anxieties of official
life, in unreserved and cheerful intercourse, that, after all, he
appeared most favorably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>By his industry, frugality and aptitude for the management
of property, he accumulated in a long life an estate more
ample than usually falls to the lot of a member of the profession
in this State; and although much reduced by the consequences
of the civil war, it was still competent to the comfort
of his large family.</p>

<p>Judge Ruffin was, until superseded by the changes made
in 1868, the oldest trustee of the University of the State,
and always one of the most efficient and active members of
the board. For more than half a century on terms of intimate
intercourse with its Presidents, Caldwell and Swain, and
the leading Professors, Mitchell, Phillips and their associates,
he was their ready counsellor and friend in any emergency;
whether in making appeals to the Legislature in behalf of the
institution for support and assistance in its seasons of adversity,
or in enforcing discipline and maintaining order, advancing
the standard of education or cheering the labors both of
the faculty and students. His criterion of a collegiate education
was high, and he illustrated by his own example the
rewards of diligent and faithful study. He retained a better
acquaintance with the dead languages than any of his compeers
we have named except Gaston, Murphy, and Taylor.
In ethics, history, and the standard British classics his knowledge
was profound. In science and in natural history, more
especially in chemistry, and those departments pertaining
to agriculture, horticulture, pomology and the like, his attainments
were very considerable, as they were also in works of
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, poetry, taste and fiction, at least down to the
end of the novels of Scott and Cooper. He worthily received
the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University
of North Carolina in 1834, and the like honor is believed to
have been subsequently conferred by his alma mater at
Princeton.</p>

<p>His style and manner in conversation, in which he took
great delight and bore a distinguished part in all companies,
abounded in pleasantry, but exhibited the same wide range
of thought and information as his public performances, and
was full of entertainment and instruction to the young. His
temperament was mercurial, his actions quick and energetic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
and his whole bearing in the farthest possible degree removed
from sloth, inertness, and despondency. In political sentiment
he accorded with the school of Jefferson, and for more
than forty years was a constant reader of the <cite>Richmond Inquirer</cite>,
the editor of which, Mr. Ritchie, was his relative,
though no one entertained a more exalted reverence for the
character, abilities, and patriotism of Marshall, with whom
he cherished a familiar acquaintance while in practice before
him at the bar, and after his own elevation to the bench.
Later in life he formed a like kind and admiring acquaintance
with Chancellor Kent.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1861 the Legislature of North Carolina,
having acceded to the proposition of Virginia, on the approach
of the late rupture between the States of the Union,
to assemble a body of delegates in the City of Washington
to consider and recommend terms of reconciliation, Judge
Ruffin was appointed one of the members in the "Peace Conference,"
and is understood to have taken a conspicuous part
in its deliberations and debates. We have the testimony of
General Scott, in his autobiography, already quoted, that his
counsels in that assembly were altogether pacific. President
Buchanan, in his work in defense of his action in that important
crisis, makes assertion of the same fact. After the
failure of the efforts at adjustment, and the war, in his
opinion, had become a necessity, Judge Ruffin accepted a
seat in the State Convention of 1861, and threw into its support
all the zeal and energy of his earnest and ardent temper;
one of his sons, a grandson, and other near connections taking
part in the dangers and privations of its camps and battle-fields.
When defeat came he yielded an honest submission
and acquiescence, and renewed in perfect good faith his allegiance
to the government of the United States. Too far
advanced in years to be longer active in affairs, his chief concern
in regard to the public interests thenceforward was for
the conservation of the public weal, and that the violent convulsion,
of which we had felt the shock, and the change,
might be permitted to pass without any serious disturbance
of the great and essential principles of freedom and right
which it had been the favorite study of his life to understand
and illustrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>With the close of the war, his farm about his mansion having
experienced the desolation of an army encampment, and
its system of labor being abolished, he felt unequal to the
enterprise of its resuscitation and culture, and therefore disposed
of his estate and again took up his abode in Hillsborough.
Here, in occasional occupation as a referee of legal
controversies, in directing the assiduous culture of his garden
and grounds, in desultory reading, in which he now and then
recurred to his old favorites among the novels of Scott, in
the duties of hospitality and the converse of friends, in the
bosom of his family, he passed the evening of his days. In
the sense of imbecility or decrepitude he never grew old, but
was blessed with the enjoyment of a remarkable intellectual
vigor and fine flow of spirits almost till his dissolution. And,
in anticipation of death, in his last illness he laid an injunction
on his physician to administer to him no anodyne which
should deprive him of consciousness, as he did not wish to
die in a state of insensibility.</p>

<p>On the 15th of January, 1870, after an illness of but four
days, though he had been an invalid from an affection of the
lungs for a year or more, he breathed his last, in the eighty-third
year of his age. His end was resigned and peaceful,
and in the consolation of an enlightened and humble Christian
faith. For more than forty years a communicant of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, he was one of its most active
members in the State, and more than once represented the
Diocese in the Triennial Conventions of the Union.</p>

<p>The venerable companion of his life, a bride when not yet
fifteen, a wife for more than sixty years, yet survives to receive
the gratitude and affection of a numerous posterity and
the reverence and esteem of troops of friends.</p>

<p>This imperfect offering is a memoir, not a panegyric. It
contains not history, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">particulas historae</i>&mdash;scraps of history,
which it is hoped may not be without their use to the
future student of our annals, for the character we contemplate
is destined to be historical. His life was passed in public
view, in the most important public functions, in contact with
the most gifted and cultivated men of the State for half a
century; it ran through two generations of lawyers. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
given to a profession in which were engaged many of the
first minds of other States, and I can call to recollection no
judge of any State of the Union who in that period has left
behind him nobler or more numerous memorials of erudition,
diligence, and ability in the departments of the law he was
called to administer. The study of his performances will at
least serve to correct the error of opinions prevailing with
many at the North, that the intellectual activity of the South
delights itself only in politics.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by one of the British essayists,
as "a saying of dunces in all ages, that men of genius are
unfit for business." It is perhaps a kindred fallacy, to which
pedantry and sloth have given as much countenance on the
one hand as blissful ignorance upon the other, that high culture
and erudition, as in the case of the learned professions,
are incompatible with success in practical affairs in other departments.
We have before us the life of one who demonstrated
in his own person that it is possible for a great and
profound lawyer to take a leading part and become a shining
light in practically promoting the first and greatest of the
industrial arts, and although there be no natural connection
between these occupations, that the same well directed industry,
patience, and energy which had achieved success in the
one, was equal to a like triumph in the other; whilst in high
probity, in stainless morals, in social intercourse, in the amenities
of life, and the domestic affections and duties, his
example will be cherished in the recollection of his friends,
and may well be commended to the imitation of our youth.</p>

<h3><a name="EX" id="EX"></a>OPINION IN EX PARTE BRADLEY.</h3>

<p class="center">BY THOMAS RUFFIN.</p>


<p>This opinion of Judge Ruffin, taken at random to illustrate
his style, is not above his average.</p>

<p>His great opinions are too long and technical to be of interest
to the general reader. He thoroughly understood "the
language of the law," and used it with the utmost precision.</p>

<p>His discussion of the question at issue throws a side-light
on times fifty years agone, and will awaken memories in the
old and inquiry in the young.</p>

<p>Badger and Iredell applied to the Chief Justice for a writ
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i> in behalf of William Bradley, who had been
imprisoned for assault and battery.</p>


<p class="center">OPINION.</p>

<p><i>Ruffin, C. J.</i> At the last term of Anson Superior Court,
William Bradley was convicted of an assault and battery, and
was sentenced to pay a fine of one dollar, and "to be imprisoned
in the public jail of Anson county for twelve months,
and thereafter until the said fine and costs should be paid."
He was committed to the custody of the sheriff of the county,
and has been kept a close prisoner ever since, but has recently
tendered to the sheriff a bond with sureties to keep within
the rules of the prison (which have been laid off by the
County Court, and contain six acres), and demanded of the
sheriff to be let out of prison. This was refused by the sheriff,
upon the ground that he was required by the sentence to keep
this person within the public jail.</p>

<p>Upon an affidavit and petition of Bradley, stating those
facts, he has applied for a <i>habeas corpus</i>, that he might be
brought up and an order made for his enlargement, according
to his application to the sheriff. His counsel, however, does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
not desire that he should be put to the expense and trouble
of the writ, unless it should be thought that he is entitled to
the liberty of the rules bounds. As I had an opportunity of
consulting my brethren on the subject, I have availed myself
of it, and I now give our unanimous opinion, that the sheriff
is bound to keep the applicant a close prisoner. The application
is founded on the Act of 1741, Rev. St., c. 90, s. 11.
It enacts, that, "For the preservation of the health of such
persons as shall be committed to the county prisons, the court
shall have power to mark out such a parcel of land, as they
shall think fit, not exceeding six acres, adjoining the prison,
for the rules thereof; and every prisoner not committed for
treason or felony shall have liberty to walk therein, out of
prison, for the preservation of his or her health."</p>

<p>If there were no other objection to this application but its
novelty, that would be sufficient. It is the first that has been
made, as far as we have heard, since the act passed, which
is now more than one hundred years. If this were an
absolute right of all persons committed under sentence for
misdemeanors, there can be no doubt that it would have been
long before claimed and constantly exercised. But we think
the construction of the act is plainly against it. It seems to
have been made in reference to a known usage and regulation
respecting prisons in the mother country. There, by "rules"
of the several courts, debtors and prisoners for misdemeanors
have the liberty of walking in the prison yards, or within
such other limits as the courts prescribe for their respective
prisoners, at such hours and on such days as "the rules"
may designate. Those "grounds" came in time to be called
the "rules of the prison" because they were laid off and the
prisoners had liberty of exercise therein by rule of court for
that prison. In the same manner and for the same purpose
the grounds are to be laid out adjoining our prisons. The
courts "shall have the power," that is to say, they may lay off
ground, little or much, but not to exceed six acres, adjoining
the prison, for the rules thereof. These last words, "for the
rules thereof," show, that with each court it was left to make
such rules respecting the prisoners committed by it as to the
extent, periods and durations of enlargement out of close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
prison for exercise and health, as the situation of the prison,
the season of the year, the danger of escape or the character
of the prisoners, or the enormity or mildness of their
offenses might suggest to the court, restraining them, indeed,
from allowing more than six acres in space to any prisoner,
and from extending the liberty to traitors and felons, or persons
committed as such. Hence, also, the expression that the
prisoner may have liberty "to walk therein for the preservation
of his health," which shows that the courts had the power
to allow the prisoners merely the "liberty of walking," at
particular hours, and require them still to have their abode
in the prison. Such, at first, was no doubt, the practice. But
in laying out the bounds the rules of the court in modern
days practically exempt persons committed in execution for
debt from any imprisonment within the jail, by allowing
them to walk, not for particular hours, but at all times of the
day and night within the rules. As they are not required
to eat or sleep within the prison, they are, in effect, allowed
to live out of the walls, provided they do not go out of the
rules.</p>

<p>But with regard to persons committed under sentence for
crimes, no rules have ever been passed. At least, we have
known of none; and the applicant does not state that there is
any such rule for Anson Superior Court. We do not say
that it might not be proper, in some cases, to grant to minor
offenders the liberty of exercise and fresh air at reasonable
times and for a moderate period. But that is, necessarily, as
each court may order in regard to its own prisoners; for as
the imprisonment itself and its duration are within the discretion
of the court, so must the degree of its vigor be, at least,
as to the power of mitigating it within the extent allowed by
the statute. The reason why no <i>regula generalis</i> has been
adopted by the court, doubtless has been, that our courts are
not in the habit of sentencing convicts to imprisonment, unless
in those cases in which the courts think that, for the purposes
of correction and example, there should be actual imprisonment
during the whole period. But if there be any general
rule upon the subject in any court it would be under the control
of that court, whether each prisoner should or should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
not be allowed the indulgence, and the sentence on this person
is, "that he <em>shall</em> be imprisoned <em>in</em> the public jail of Anson
for twelve months." Of course, this prisoner cannot demand
an enlargement out of prison, as a matter of right.</p>

<p>As I should be under the necessity of remanding the prisoner,
if brought up on <i>habeas corpus</i>, I decline issuing the
writ at all, according to the suggestion of his counsel.</p>

<p>Thomas Bragg was the son of Thomas and Margaret Crossland
Bragg, and was born in the town of Warrenton, in Warren
county, on the 9th day of November, 1810. His father
was a carpenter and contractor, a man of strong will, good
judgment, and hard common sense, who devoted the fruits
of his labor to the education of a large family of children.
John, an older brother of Thomas, was a distinguished judge
of Alabama, and a member of Congress from the Mobile District,
in 1852, but declined a renomination. General Braxton
Bragg, whose military reputation is familiar to the country,
was a younger brother. Alexander J. was an architect of
high standing in Alabama. Dunbar was a leading merchant
in Texas; and William, the youngest brother, died near Chattanooga,
July 25, 1863, from wounds received in battle.
Mrs. Mary L. Cuthbert, widow of the late James E. Cuthbert,
a sister, and the last of the children, died recently in Petersburg,
Va.</p>

<p>Thomas Bragg received his preliminary schooling at the
Academy in Warrenton and his education was completed at
Captain Partridge's Military School, in Middletown, Connecticut,
where he remained about two and a half years. Soon
after returning from Middletown he commenced the study of
law under the late Judge Hall, of Warrenton, one of the
judges of the Supreme Court, and, on obtaining his license
to practice in the courts of the State, he started out, with
a horse and stick gig and fifty dollars, for Jackson, the county-seat
of Northampton county, N. C., which place he made his
home in the spring of 1833. This was all the assistance he
had, but his paying practice was immediate, and he never
needed aid from any other quarter.</p>

<p>Shortly after settling in Jackson, Benjamin B. Blume, who
was County Attorney, resigned the office and removed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Petersburg, Va., selling his library to the subject of our
sketch, who was elected County Attorney, beating his opponent,
Colonel Samuel B. Spruill, the office then being worth
about five hundred dollars. He was a strong and vigorous
prosecuting officer, discharging the duties in strict conformity
to his oath, and showing neither favor to a friend nor resentment
to an enemy. His execution of the office was so rigid
that it affected his popularity; evidence of which was visible,
in some quarters, even up to the time he assumed the office of
Governor. Upon one occasion, after he had spoken in the
prosecution of a citizen of considerable prominence, Mr. B. F.
Moore, who was counsel for the defendant, made strictures
upon his course, and charged that his zeal was the result more
of feeling and spite than of his conceived duties under his
oath. He was seen to bow gracefully, but determinedly, to
Mr. Moore, as he proceeded with his speech. Immediately
after the adjournment of court, a note was borne from him to
Mr. Moore by Colonel Spier Whitaker. It was with some
difficulty that the matter was settled, but friends interposed,
and it was satisfactorily adjusted to both parties; and these
men were not formal in their subsequent intercourse, but, on
the contrary, their relations were always cordial and friendly.
Mr. Moore's strong and feeling speech in the Supreme Court-room,
the day after Governor Bragg's funeral, clearly shows
this.</p>

<p>It was not long after he had been at the bar when an important
case was begun in Hertford county, <i>Beale</i> vs. <i>Askew</i>. It
was a suit for damages for libel. A. J. Askew was charged
with sending to the Norfolk (Va.) <cite>Herald</cite>, then edited by
Thomas G. Broughton, Esq., a notice of Beale's marriage to
a woman in Winton of infamous character. The case was
moved to Chowan and tried in Edenton. Bragg and William
W. Cherry, then very young men, appeared for
Askew, and Judge Augustus Moore and Mr. Kinney, at that
time the leading Eastern lawyers, were the opposing counsel.
Governor Bragg alluded in his speech to his youth and to his
being a stranger as working to his disadvantage before the
jury. Mr. Kinney, in his kindest manner, complimented in
his speech these young men for their able conduct and management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of their case, and predicted their future usefulness
and distinction. Mr. Cherry died when quite a young man.
He possessed a powerful intellect, and was unquestionably,
the most brilliant speaker the East ever had.</p>

<p>On the 4th day of October, 1837, Bragg was united in marriage
to Miss Isabella M. Cuthbert, of Petersburg, Va. He
first met her in Jackson while on a visit to her sister, Mrs.
Starke, whose husband was at that time engaged in business
in Jackson. Their associated lives were long and happy, and
marked by the most devoted attention on his part, and
cemented by a mutual affection and tenderness. She only
survived him a few years.</p>

<p>Bragg was a close and hard student. Except when called
away on business, he was rarely out of his office; and he left
his house at night only when urgent engagements compelled
it, which was infrequent. So closely did he confine himself
to study and to the full preparation of his cases, and so fully
was his time occupied, that he seemed estranged from the
community. These seclusive habits, together with strongly
drawn party lines, destroyed to a degree that social interchange
which a more general intercourse would naturally have engendered.
He was not what might be considered a popular man
of the town, but his high moral worth and his honorable
and commendable course of life accorded him the highest
consideration and respect.</p>

<p>His daily course was to smoke his pipe and read his newspapers
for about half an hour after breakfast, then repair to
his office, which was near to his house and on his lot, read law,
and prepare his cases, smoking a good deal of the time, until
dinner. After dinner he would devote another half-hour to
newspaper-reading and his pipe, and then go to his office,
resuming his law studies and duties until late in the evening,
when he would either take a ride or a walk with his wife.
After supper he would take his smoke and read newspapers,
magazines or other literary works until about ten o'clock, his
usual bedtime. He rarely read law at night, except
sometimes shortly before attending the Supreme Court, when
it might be necessary for him to do so to prepare cases for
argument there. Such was his regular course of life at Jackson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and he was as regular in it as clockwork. He was not an
early riser, usually rising just before breakfast, which was
about nine o'clock in winter and about seven in summer. He
never slept in the afternoons, and during the warm summer
evenings he would occasionally lie down on a lounge, or
sofa, which he kept in his office, and read his law books,
but he would never take an evening nap. During his two
terms as Governor he would, when he had taken his after-dinner
smoke, go direct to the executive office, and remain
there until late in the evening, and if alone, it was rare for
one to enter and find him not engaged in either reading or
writing. He was an inveterate smoker, and followed the habit
so persistently that he could not relinquish it, and he carried
his pipe to his courts as regularly as he did his law books.
His constitution was, no doubt, though not perceptibly,
affected by it, and the late gifted Dr. Charles E. Johnson, his
family physician, was fully impressed that it shortened his
life and precipitated the disease of which he died.</p>

<p>Bragg practiced law, regularly, in the Courts of Northampton,
Halifax, Hertford, and Gates counties up to the
time he became Governor. When employed in special cases,
he would attend the courts of Chowan and Washington counties.
He had a large and controlling practice, appearing in
nearly every important case, yet but twice did his practice
amount to four thousand dollars a year, and it was brought
to that figure by these special courts, the highest fee being
three hundred dollars, which was the largest single fee he
ever received before the war. He was a diligent and faithful
worker, and a moderate charger. One of his greatest efforts
at the bar, before the war, probably, was made in the case of
the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Garrett</i>. Garrett was tried for murder in Northampton
county, before Judge Bailey, about 1853. He was
defended by Bragg and Mr. B. F. Moore, and the case occupied
two days in taking the testimony. Both of these gentlemen
made strong speeches, but Bragg's speech was particularly
strong. He was deeply interested in the case and
bestowed much labor upon it. He believed his client not
guilty. The State was represented by M. W. Ransom, it
being his first appearance as Attorney-General at Northampton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
court. He was a young man, and, having such able lawyers
to confront, much sympathy was felt by the audience
in the court room for him. He, however, did not need it.
He saw the necessity for the full development of all the tact,
brain power, and legal knowledge at his command. During
the whole trial he took not a note, and he concluded the argument
alike to the astonishment and admiration of the court,
jury, and spectators, the very culmination, beyond doubt,
of the greatest legal effort of his life. Garrett was convicted
of murder, but before the day appointed for his execution he
broke jail and was never afterwards captured or heard from.</p>

<p>It is by some supposed, and has been by some remarked,
that Bragg developed as a lawyer after the war, and that up
to that time he was merely a fair lawyer, with a good local
reputation. This is a very great mistake. Though he may
not have achieved an extended State reputation, yet he was
recognized by the bar of the State as a strong lawyer, and he
was accepted before the war by the people of the East as one
of the leading, if not the leading, lawyer of that section.</p>

<p>In 1842 he was elected to the Legislature&mdash;House of Commons&mdash;defeating
Thomas J. Gatling, a brother of the inventor
of the Gatling gun. In 1844 he was defeated for the Legislature
by Judge David A. Barnes, who had just before this
come to the Northampton bar and had settled in Jackson.
After this he sought no office, but was an active worker in the
county political campaigns. In 1844 he was Presidential
Elector on the Polk and Dallas ticket for the First District, his
opponent being William W. Cherry, Esq., of Bertie county.
In 1848 he was again elector for the First District on the Cass
and Butler ticket, his opponent being the Hon. Kenneth
Rayner, of Hertford county, one of the strongest political
speakers of his day, and a man much to be dreaded in debate.
At this time Bragg was not widely known in politics, and it
was considered by the Whigs that Mr. Rayner would have a
"walk-over." Their first meeting was at Rich Square, in
Northampton, twelve miles from Jackson. Mr. Rayner's
friends in Jackson (and the town was about all Whig) said
they were "going out to see Rayner eat Bragg up," but the
"eating up" was not done at that time, and they came back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
not so exhilarated as they went. Mr. Rayner had met his
match, and Bragg had fully satisfied his Democratic hearers
on that occasion. This campaign was exciting and ably
conducted; and after it was ended Mr. Rayner was frequently
heard to say that Thomas Bragg was the ablest debater and
the strongest opponent he had ever met on the stump.</p>

<p>In 1852 he was again Elector for the Ninth District on the
Pierce and King Presidential ticket, his opponent being Hon.
David A. Barnes, of Northampton county. Judge Barnes
was a ready and effective speaker. They had often crossed
political swords. This campaign was marked by courtesy and
ability.</p>

<p>In 1854 the Whig party nominated for Governor General
Alfred Dockery, of Richmond county, and at that time Governor
Bragg's name was prominently mentioned as the Democratic
candidate. General Dockery opened his campaign at
Gatesville, in Gates county. Bragg was there attending
court, and he was called on to reply, which he did very
successfully. It is said that he made a speech that much
gratified and pleased his party friends. The week following
the General spoke at Edenton, during court, and Bragg again
replied with equal effect. Soon thereafter the Democratic
convention assembled in Raleigh, and Bragg was unanimously
nominated for Governor. He accepted this nomination with
reluctance, and for a little while considered it. He had a
good practice, amounting to about thirty-five hundred dollars
a year. His home was comfortable and attractive, and his
manner of life was quiet and contented. It was natural that
a man thus situated and surrounded, and not beset by the
disquietude of political strife and commotion should hesitate
before disrupting such congenial associations. Upon reflection,
however, he accepted, and when his courts were ended,
joined General Dockery, and entered upon one of the most
remarkable campaigns ever had in the State. General
Dockery had been canvassing without any regular opponent,
but the training incident to his having been pitted against
some of the best Democratic talent in the State, as he went
along, had developed him into a dangerous antagonist even
for Bragg. The campaign waxed hotter and hotter, up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the day of the election, and, in all probability, had the election
been a month later, Dockery would have been victorious.</p>

<p>An incident of the campaign may afford passing amusement.
Dockery, in one of his speeches, had characterized his
opponent as the aristocratic candidate, and said that he drove a
fine horse, rode in a high sulky, and wore kid gloves. Bragg,
in his rejoinder, stated that he was not at all an aristocrat, but
only a hard-toiling lawyer, and the son of a plain carpenter,
who had exhausted his means in educating his children.
"But, fellow-citizens," said he, "General Dockery himself is
in fact the aristocratic candidate, for he lives in the only brick
house in the whole county of Richmond." At this juncture
the General rose right up behind him, and, raising up his
hands before the crowd, exclaiming in a loud voice: "Yes,
and these old yaller hands made all the bricks that went into
it, and toted them up thar, too." The effect was crushing,
the crowd yelled, and Bragg was afterwards heard to say he
wished he had left the old brick house alone. He defeated
Dockery by a majority of two thousand and eighty-five votes,
and was inaugurated Governor of North Carolina on the first
day of January, 1855.</p>

<p>In 1856 he was again nominated for the second term, his
opponent this time being Hon. John A. Gilmer, of Guilford
county. Mr. Gilmer had a high reputation both as lawyer and
politician. He was looked upon as the strongest man of his
party, but Governor Bragg made it at once manifest that he
was his equal in this admirably conducted campaign. Being
desirous at their first joint discussion to have their positions
clearly and correctly put before the people of the State, Governor
Bragg carefully prepared a full account of their first
meeting, which took place at Murphy, in Cherokee county,
and sent it to a friend to be published in the Raleigh
<cite>Standard</cite>. It was known only to his friend and the editor,
and so impartially was it done that no one suspected its authorship.</p>

<p>In this campaign with Mr. Gilmer, Governor Bragg, though
he confined himself to the record, was quite severe on the
course of Mr. Rayner, who had espoused the "Know-Nothing"
cause. The published accounts of these references so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
irritated Mr. Rayner that for a long time bitterness existed,
and their intercourse became entirely estranged. During the
State Fair of 1858, Mr. Rayner met an intimate friend of the
Governor at the corner of Fayetteville street, where stood the
old North Carolina Book Store, and said to him: "I have a
high regard for Bragg; our estrangement is not well founded,
and I desire to renew our former relations." This was told
the Governor a few moments afterwards in the executive
office, who simply bowed his head, making no reply. That
day, seeing Mr. Rayner on the fair grounds, he went straight
to him and offered his hand. These men were good friends
afterwards.</p>

<p>Governor Bragg defeated Mr. Gilmer by a majority of
twelve thousand six hundred and twenty-eight votes, and was
the second time inaugurated Governor of North Carolina on
the first day of January, 1857.</p>

<p>In his judicial appointments he exercised sound judgment.
He was impressed with the belief that young men of promise
and of good and studious habits would make the best judges,
as they would subject themselves to greater application.
Under this view he appointed Jesse G. Shepherd, of Cumberland,
and Samuel J. Person, of New Hanover, Judges of
the Superior Courts, and they adorned the bench and were
among our most efficient judges. In this connection, in 1855,
he conferred the appointment of Attorney-General upon Hon.
Joseph B. Batchelor, then a young man, and now one of the
leading lawyers of the State.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1856, and about the time of the State Fair,
the Governors of the Southern States were called to meet in
Raleigh to consider such action as might become necessary
in the event of Frémont's election to the Presidency of the
United States in November following. Governor Wise, of
Virginia, Governor Adams, of South Carolina, and Governor
Bragg, of North Carolina, were the only Governors present.
An informal meeting was held in the parlors at the executive
mansion. Among others present were General L. O'B.
Branch, Governor Holden, Wesley Jones, A. M. Lewis, M.
A. Bledsoe, Joseph A. Engelhard, and Pulaski Cowper. The
<cite>Raleigh Register</cite>, then edited by Major Seaton Gales, a vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and ready writer, charged that this meeting of Governors
was a step to break up the Union, and was quite severe in its
criticisms. Governor Wise was warm and determined in his
views, and favored immediate resistance, by fighting in the
Union, in the event of Frémont's election, and that his election
should be accepted as the overt act. Governor Bragg's
position was quite conservative, his views being calmly stated.
His sound reason, prudence, and wise counsel produced a deep
impression, and was the subject of much favorable comment
the next day. Owing to the small number of Governors
present, nothing definite was outlined, but this may be characterized
as the first secession meeting ever held in the South.</p>

<p>In the Legislature of 1858 Governor Bragg was elected
United States Senator. He took a high stand in the Senate,
and made a noted speech on the bill providing for the Florida
Claims. He also took an active part in the discussion of other
important measures of that time.</p>

<p>When the war had commenced, and the State had seceded,
he resigned his seat in the Senate and returned to Raleigh.
Upon the death of Governor Ellis, which occurred in June,
1861, Hon. Henry T. Clark, of Edgecombe county, by virtue
of his office as Speaker of the Senate, became Governor. Governor
Clark, under the law giving him power to appoint three
persons to act as his military council, appointed Governor
Bragg, Colonel Spier Whitaker, and General D. M. Barringer
to compose this board. Governor Bragg held this position
for only a short time, when he resigned.</p>

<p>Though not openly opposed to the war, and sensible of the
just grounds that the South had to resist the unconstitutional
encroachments of the North, yet he did not believe the South
could establish her independence. He thought the preponderance
of the North's population, together with wealth and
resources, easy access to aid from the outside world, advantage
of retaining the government and its possession of the
entire navy, were too great odds against us. He saw that the
spirit of our people was too high, their determination of
resistance too united to take kindly any suggestions of doubt
or difficulty. He therefore kept his opinions within his own
breast. He said to a friend on his front porch, in July, 1861:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
"Our people are excited, and do not consider, I fear, the
strength of the enemy; they look upon it as an easy job, and
they believe the war will soon be over; but, in my opinion, it
will be of long duration, and hotly contested on both sides.
When our ports are blockaded and the gunboats come up our
rivers, as will be the case, and our people encounter the
hardships that will follow, I fear their spirits will weaken and
dissension will come. I do not think we will succeed; but I
will say this only to you." Continuing, he said: "I shall
do all in my power to secure our success. I will stand by
the old State, and if the worst shall ultimately come, as I
very much fear, I will go down with her, and when all is over
I will do what I can to save what is left of her."</p>

<p>After the removal of the Confederate Government to Richmond,
Va., Mr. Davis, in 1863, tendered to him the position
of Attorney-General of the Confederate States, which he
accepted. He held this high office but a few months, when
he resigned. Some speculation obtained as to the cause of
his early retirement. Suffice it to say, that his reasons for
doing so were cogent and well-founded, as all of his conclusions
were. They were of a private nature, and need not be
related in this sketch.</p>

<p>Upon his acceptance of the place of Attorney-General he
rented out his residence in Raleigh and removed his family
to Petersburg, Va. In the spring of 1864 he returned with
his family to Raleigh, where he was residing when the war
ended.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the war found him, like a large number
of the people of the South, wasted in substance, without means
or prospects, and bereft of all save a shelter from the winds
and the cold. He was reluctant to return to the practice of
the law, and had determined not to again resume it. He had
been out of the practice from 1855 to 1865, and had entirely
neglected its study during that time. He said he was rusty,
and had about forgotten all the law he ever knew, and nothing
but a dependent family could induce him to take it up
again. He did resume it, and gave to it his former labor
and endurance, and the eminence and success he attained is
well known to the bar and people of the State.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt the greatest forensic effort of Governor
Bragg's life was his speech in the Johnston will case tried
before Judge A. S. Merrimon, at Edenton, in February, 1867.
Probably so large and able an array of counsel was never before
engaged in any suit in North Carolina. The late Mr.
James C. Johnston, the wealthiest man in the State, had devised
his estate to the late Mr. Edward Wood and his (Mr.
Johnston's) three overseers, neither of whom were related to
him. The next of kin sought to break the will, alleging
mental disqualification. The case occupied twenty-three days
in the trial, and the best legal talent in the State was engaged
in it. The attorneys representing the will were B. F. Moore,
W. N. H. Smith, R. R. Heath, H. A. Gilliam, P. H. Winston,
Edward Conigland, John Pool, and T. H. Gilliam; those
representing the contestants were Bragg, Graham, Vance,
Augustus Moore, William Eaton, James W. Hinton, of Norfolk,
Va., and William F. Martin. Governor Bragg was the
leader on his side, and Mr. Moore was the leader on the opposite
side. Dr. Hammond, of New York, the distinguished
specialist, was introduced as a witness, and presented as an
expert to show the want of mental capacity of the testator.
His examination, by the counsel of both sides, was most
searching, and it is said that his cross-examination by Mr.
B. F. Moore was as fine, if not the finest, professional work
of the kind ever done in the State. Judge Merrimon presided
with great ability, patience and impartiality, and well
sustained the high reputation he had for being one of our
ablest Superior Court Judges; Governor Bragg spoke seven
hours, making the greatest speech of his life before a jury.
Chief Justice Merrimon, referring to this speech, said:
"Upon an issue of fact it was the strongest speech I ever
heard." Judge Gilliam said: "Governor Bragg was at his
greatest (he was a very great man), and by his ability and his
preëminent tact in the management of his side of the case
for a long time put in peril the integrity of a will which
should never have been questioned." The will was established.
An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, but the
decision of the court below was affirmed.</p>

<p>The <i>habeas corpus</i> cases in 1870 are well remembered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
The history of those times and the incidents arising have not
been forgotten by the people of the State. That the great
writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>, issuing from a properly constituted
authority, should have been entirely disregarded, was a blow
at the rights of the individual and a significant stride towards
executive usurpation and the overthrow of the rule of law.
That there should be no presumption of innocence until the
contrary was shown, and that the surest and quickest avenue
of establishing innocence of crime should have been obstructed
by a usurped military despotism, betokened that the liberty of
the citizen was fast vanishing, and he was soon to become
helpless indeed. Governor Bragg was among the foremost in
vindicating the law and in maintaining and preserving its
supremacy. He made a strong appeal for the defense of
right and justice, and protested, in burning eloquence, against
the least infringement of the citizen's security, so watchfully
guarded by the Constitution. His memorable words are
engraven in the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>While Governor Bragg was making his forcible appeal for
constitutional law and liberty, the late venerable Judge Battle
was listening with marked interest and attention. As the
speaker extolled the past lustre of North Carolina for the
maintenance of law and liberty, and contrasted her former
power and renown with the impending destruction of her
people's highest privilege and greatest boon&mdash;their mighty
writ of right and safety&mdash;the brightest jewel that ever decked
the vesture of the English law&mdash;heeded for centuries, and
ever granted when fitly craved&mdash;this eminent and pure judge,
thoughtful of his State's honor, could not restrain his emotion,
and tears trickled down his whitened cheeks. When
the speech was concluded Judge Battle said that it was the
most eloquent and powerful argument he had ever heard in
that court room. This was a compliment indeed; because,
with honorable distinction, for many years, he had sat upon
the bench of that high Court, and had heard the arguments
of the State's brightest legal luminaries, whose broad intellectualism
was the wonder and the admiration of the time,
and whose lives and reputations have done so much to mould
and to make the Court's past and present history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The last great effort of Governor Bragg was in the Holden
impeachment trial, the history of which is fresh in recollection.
He appeared for the State, and pressed with fervor the
impeachment. He made a long, close, and exhaustive argument,
was listened to with the deepest and most marked attention,
and his speech was considered by many among the best
of his life. When he concluded Mr. Conigland, one of Governor
Holden's counsel, walked over to where he sat, and,
taking his hand, said: "Governor, you have made a grand
speech, but it does not equal your Johnston will speech."
Mr. Paul C. Cameron, who was his schoolmate and drillmaster
at Captain Partridge's military school, a man ripe in
years, and yet riper in intellect, judgment, and learning, said
that he had observed Governor Bragg from his early manhood
to his death, and he had never known any one who had better
sustained himself before the people in every capacity; and
that though he was confronted in this trial by the strongest
lawyers in the State, whose reputations were without limit,
he considered that his speech was the most complete and exhaustive
of any delivered on that occasion. General Thomas
L. Clingman, a statesman of the old school, pronounced this
speech as "overwhelming and unanswerable."</p>

<p>Governor Bragg was a well-fledged and thorough lawyer,
and he made himself so by constant application and close
study. He was a man of vigorous intellect and strong common
sense. He was one among the few lawyers who studied
thoroughly his adversary's case and anticipated the points he
would most likely present, and was generally ready to meet
and combat them. In conducting the examination of a witness
he exhibited great tact and skill. This faculty of cross-examination,
so effective in conducting suits, was a potent element
in his practice, and gave him no little advantage in the
trial of cases.</p>

<p>He was an open and frank practitioner, never taking a
"nigh cut," but was just and magnanimous, and was possessed
of the confidence and esteem of the profession throughout
the State. He was as well-rounded a lawyer as the State
ever had.</p>

<p>Just thirteen months prior to his death he associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
him Judge George V. Strong, a leading lawyer of the Goldsboro
bar. This was an able combination, and promised the
utmost success, for during the term of their connection their
practice amounted to over nineteen thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Probably no two men were more generally pitted against
each other in the courts which they attended than Governor
Bragg and the late Chief Justice Smith. Their style of
speaking was different. Governor Bragg's was simple, strong,
and engaging; Judge Smith's was easy, forceful and very
fluent. Their temperaments were also diverse. If an important
case went adversely to Governor Bragg he dismissed
it from his mind, and was not depressed about it; but Judge
Smith was for the time keenly sensitive, and took to heart the
loss of his case. Their intercourse, however, notwithstanding
these frequent conflicts, was genial and their friendship true;
but Judge Smith accepted it not graciously that Governor
Bragg should have come down into his district and taken
part against him in his campaign for Congress against Doctor
Shaw. In a previous campaign with Colonel Outlaw, Doctor
Shaw did not feel that Governor Bragg, who then resided
in the district, had taken a sufficiently active part in his behalf,
and being now hard pressed by Judge Smith, and the
party needing all help at hand, Governor Bragg yielded to the
general request and made several speeches in the district.
But this spasmodic feeling soon vanished, this circumstance
was forgotten, and these men left behind them lives alike well
spent and distinguished and memories equally honored and
revered.</p>

<p>When the Holden impeachment trial took place Governor
Bragg had begun to fail, but not very perceptibly. The
severe struggle, mental and physical, which he underwent
during that trial hastened his end. He began soon after its
conclusion rapidly to decline, and it was visible to all that his
"last of earth" was fast approaching. It was painful to see
the pallor of his countenance increase day by day, but he did
not give up and it may be said that he worked in the harness
up to his death.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 19th of January, 1872, he took his bed,
never again to arise from it. He knew he was going to die,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
but he was calm and composed, exhibiting not the slightest
fear of death. He said: "For the benefit of my family
I would like to live ten years longer, but apart from that the
matter of death gives me no concern."</p>

<p>His will was in his own handwriting, and in these words:
"I give and bequeath to my wife, Isabella M. Bragg, all my
real and personal estate of every description whatsoever.
She knows my wishes, and I know she will carry them out."
He was kept alive for a day or two with whiskey and gruel,
and when this was given to him he would ask, "How much
whiskey, and how much gruel?" Being told, he said, "You
see the whiskey predominates. This is done to keep me alive
for a little while, when I know I cannot live. I do not want
it done. There is no use in keeping me alive in this way and
giving you all the trouble of waiting on me. I protest
against it."</p>

<p>On the evening before he died the door-bell rang. He saw
his friend Mr. Cowper go to the door, and on his return he
asked who it was, and being told that it was Governor Graham,
said: "I have a high regard for him, and I regret very
much that he was not asked in. I want you to go down to his
room and tell him I am very sorry he was not brought in to
see me, and that I should be pleased to see him." Governor
Graham was much impressed and deeply moved when the
message was delivered to him.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening he called his family to his bedside,
and in beautiful language of wisdom gave them counsel and
advice. In the midst of sorrow which such a solemn occasion
would naturally bring, his eye was not moistened, his voice
did not falter, and as calmly as if he were going on a short
journey, he imparted to them words of advice "like apples of
gold in pictures of silver." "My children," said he, "I wish
to impress one thing upon you: always stand together, comfort
and assist each other, consider that no necessity can arise
by which you could feel justified in raising a hand or uttering
a word one against the other."</p>

<p>Shortly before his death he uttered these words: "I have
no doubt that I have my sins and transgressions to account for.
All men must so account. I have endeavored to lead an exemplary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
life. I have never seen the time that I felt I could
be induced, through fear, favor, affection, reward, or the hope
of reward, to do otherwise than my conscience would dictate
to me as right and proper. The future has always been to
me, and is now, a deep, dark mystery."</p>

<p>A little while before day on Sunday morning, while resting
quietly, but not sleeping, he heard the sound of wood being
put on the fire in the adjoining room, and remarked: "It
must be near day; I hear them making a fire in the next
room." A few minutes after this he straightened himself in
bed, placed his head on a line with his body, folded his arms
across his breast, and in a little while was dead. It was on
Sunday morning, January 21, 1872, about the hour of five
o'clock, that he thus peacefully passed away in the sixty-second
year of his age. He left a wife and seven children&mdash;three
sons and four daughters. The wife and two sons have
since "passed over the river" and entered the vale of the
future and into the "deep, dark mystery."</p>

<p>He was buried the next day in Oakwood Cemetery, near
the city of Raleigh. Both Houses of the Legislature and the
Superior Court of Wake, then in session, adjourned for the
day, and all the business houses of the city closed their doors
to show their respect for his character and worth. On the
following day a large meeting was held in the Supreme
Court-room to do further honor to the life and services of the
distinguished dead.</p>

<p>He was a man of kind heart, tender sympathies and noble
impulses; a devoted husband and an indulgent father; and
though he was not demonstrative, yet his friendship was
valuable, because it was consistent and true. He was as
true a man as ever trod the soil of his native land.</p>

<p>The younger members of the bar will recall with pleasure
his courteous bearing to them, the delight it seemed to give
him to render them assistance, and the painstaking aid he
would bestow when his legal advice was solicited. The older
members will long remember his quiet and dignified demeanor,
his social intercourse, his manliness of character and
his integrity, merit and worth.</p>

<p>He possessed those qualities which adorn and elevate society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and exalt and ennoble human character. He has left a high
and noble name, a reputation unspotted and untarnished&mdash;a
priceless legacy to his posterity, and an enduring heritage to
his State and country. It will not be dimmed as time proceeds.</p>

<p>The account of the discussion at Murphy, Cherokee county,
previously referred to, is reproduced, and appended hereto,
as interesting matter, showing the impartiality with which
it was done, and calling to mind some of the issues of former
and better days. This was Mr. Gilmer's first appointment,
and Governor Bragg, seeing it announced in the <cite>Raleigh Register</cite>,
went there to meet him. Desiring to put him on
record, and have the East apprised of his position, he wrote
the account of the discussion as given in the <cite>Standard</cite> of
May, 1856, and sent it to the writer to deliver to Mr. Holden,
with request that no intimation be given as to the writer of
the article. No mention of this was made until after Governor
Bragg's death, and upon the publication of this sketch.</p>

<p>The Bragg and Dockery campaign closed on the day of
election at Murphy in August, 1854, and the Bragg and
Gilmer campaign opened there in May, 1856.</p>

<h3><a name="ACCOUNT" id="ACCOUNT"></a>ACCOUNT OF A POLITICAL DISCUSSION.<br />
(From the <cite>North Carolina Standard</cite> of May, 1856).</h3>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Murphy, Cherokee Co.</span>, May 9, 1856.</p>

<p>
<i>Editors of the North Carolina Standard.</i><br />
</p>

<p><i>Gentlemen:</i>&mdash;The discussion between the gubernatorial candidates
opened here yesterday, and I propose to give you the
points made and the substance of what was said on that occasion.
There were probably two hundred persons present,
and there would have been more had it been generally known
that both candidates would be present. Until Governor
Bragg arrived it was doubted whether he would attend, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<cite>Standard</cite> announcing his intention to do so did not reach
us until the day of his arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilmer opened the discussion by informing the people
that his name was John A. Gilmer&mdash;that he was a candidate
for the office of Governor, and had come among them for
the purpose of presenting his claims for their suffrages. He
said he had found the country beautiful and romantic far
beyond his expectations&mdash;never having before been on this side
the mountains&mdash;and that when he was in the Legislature he
voted for the measures introduced for their relief and for the
improvement of their section.</p>

<p>He said that a short time ago he had no intention of becoming
a candidate&mdash;that he had not now, nor ever had, any political
ambition, but that he had listened to the importunities of
friends, and had yielded rather to feeling than to his better
judgment.</p>

<p>He said the organ of the party to which his opponent
belonged had said that he had a bad political record, and it had
referred to many of his votes and addresses to show that he
was a Western man. Well, he was ready to defend these
votes and addresses; they were brought forward to injure him
in the East. He was then justified in making an appeal to
the people of the West to sustain him as a Western man.
First, he was charged with having voted to distribute the
school fund according to white instead of federal population.
He said it was true and asked if he had not done right
in so doing. He referred to the first law introduced and
passed under the auspices of Bartlett Yancey, Esq., to raise
the fund and distribute it among the white children of the
State. In 1838-'39 it was submitted to the people and
accepted on that basis. In 1842, when the Democrats got
into power, they altered the law to the federal basis, the effect
of which was to give to a child in the East five or six times
as much as to one in the West. This was unjust, and was a
violation of the original agreement upon which the fund was
raised. He further said that had Western men been true to
themselves, Governor Reid never could have been elected,
occupying the position he did upon this question; that <em>party</em>
was allowed to overcome their rights and true interests; for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
taking the counties favoring the present mode of distributing
the fund and those against it, there would be found a majority
of fourteen or fifteen thousand in the latter. In the
vote he had given he had carried out the will of his constituents,
and he put it to them to say if it was fair to charge him
with being a Western man with a view to injure him. He
hoped, if such was the case, the West would stand by him.
Next, as to free suffrage. He had been charged with being
opposed to that. This was not true. He was always for it,
provided it could be passed in a proper manner and with such
guards and qualifications as, in his opinion, ought to go with
it. He preferred a convention. He could not see why
the West was disturbed on that question, willing as she
was to go into convention on the federal basis. There all
things could be settled. They could elect their justices of
the peace by the people, and establish cheap justices' courts
for the trial of petty offenses, and thus keep them from the
courts; that it was important that justices should be elected by
the people, as they laid the county taxes.</p>

<p>He said he voted against the present free-suffrage bill because
there was no provision in it to prevent the undue taxation
of land; that the Senate, as now constituted, was a check
on such taxation; but, abolish the freehold qualification for
voters, and where would the check be; that he had offered an
amendment himself which, had it passed, he would have
voted for the bill, and waived his objection to the legislative
mode of amendment; that the object of this amendment was
to provide simply a protection to lands by requiring land, the
slave poll and white poll to be taxed alike; that, in his opinion,
something ought to be adopted to protect the landholder.</p>

<p>He said that the <cite>Standard</cite> had called him the "shin-plaster
candidate." It was true that his face appeared upon the bills
of a small bank in his town, but he was in no way concerned
in the same, and had no interest in the institution. He was,
however, opposed to the law, and would make war upon any
law which undertook to do away with small notes. Why take
away small notes, the only currency which a poor man could
get? The rich could get large bills, but they were beyond
the reach of a poor man. (Here Mr. Gilmer entered into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
rather elaborate argument to sustain the policy of small banknotes,
and read the <cite>Bank Note Reporter</cite> and other authorities
to show that true policy required their free circulation, and
that the worst consequences had followed their discontinuance
in some of the States.)</p>

<p>He next shadowed forth a project for a new bank, to be
owned in part by the State and part by individuals. For every
one hundred dollars the State owns in railroad stock he would
have her own a like amount in stock in the bank, and the same
as to individuals; something was said also as to State bonds
forming a part of the basis, but the writer did not clearly
catch the idea.</p>

<p>It was insisted, however, by Mr. Gilmer, that such a bank
would be very profitable, and that the State would realize
enough from the profits to pay the interest of the State debt,
and relieve the people from taxation; and the plan was, he
said, for the bank to issue mostly one and two dollar notes for
currency, as in South Carolina.</p>

<p>He was, too, in favor of having our State bonds, and the
interest on the same, payable in North Carolina, and not in
New York, and thus keeping the money of our people at
home. He said the national debt of England, being due to
her own people, strengthened her, while ours acted as a continual
drain to pay interest in New York.</p>

<p>After speaking one and a half hours, Mr. Gilmer said he
desired, before he closed, to say something on Federal politics,
and the principles of the American party, of which he was a
candidate.</p>

<p>He said when Mr. Fillmore left the Presidency all was quiet.
He had approved of the Compromise measures; and when Boston
had rebelled against the fugitive-slave law, he declared he
would enforce the law or burn the city, and it was enforced.
We had extremists at both ends of the Union. Formerly, the
Nashville Convention said the Union should be dissolved
unless the Missouri Compromise line should be adopted.
Now, the black Republicans said it should be dissolved unless
it was restored.</p>

<p>Mr. Fillmore, in his message, said the existing laws were a
finality on the subject of slavery&mdash;both the great parties said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
so in 1852, and agreed to abide by it. Did they do it? No;
hence the troubles we now have. He had no doubt but that
Mr. Pierce had acted honestly, but he had appointed freesoilers
from the North and fire-eaters from the South, in order
to reconcile all; but this had not been the result, and the country
could only be saved by the honest men of both parties.
He, therefore, advocated the principles of the American party&mdash;that
Americans should rule America&mdash;that the influence of
foreigners was great&mdash;that it gave the North a preponderating
increase of population&mdash;that it ought to be checked, and that
foreigners ought to remain here twenty-one years before voting,
and that Catholics who owed allegiance to the Pope ought
not to be allowed to hold office; that no one could insist that
this was persecution; that the charge that it was was false and
unfounded, and it was known to be so.</p>

<p>He then asked who was the founder of the American party.
Said it was George Washington, and read from several of his
letters to show it. He also read from a speech of Mr. Buchanan
as to foreign influence, etc., and, after justifying the
course of his party as to the Catholics, he closed, having
spoken two hours and ten minutes.</p>

<p>Governor Bragg arose, and said: Two years ago this summer
he closed the canvass with his then competitor. It had
pleased a majority of the people of the State to elect him
Governor. He had acted as such since the first of January,
1855. He had endeavored to discharge all his duties faithfully.
The people, however, would be the judges of that.
He would say, however, that he was not aware of any charges
against him for not doing so; and if there was no just ground
for complaint, then he submitted to all fair-minded men
whether he had not now some right to ask at their hands a
liberal and generous support in the present contest.</p>

<p>He said he concurred with Mr. Gilmer as to the beauty and
fertility of their country, and as to what he had said in relation
to its improvement, and hoped to see the day when its now
comparatively hidden and locked up resources would be laid
open and developed.</p>

<p>He said that he was surprised to hear his competitor to-day
enter into the discussion of some matters which he had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
supposed would be brought into this canvass, and he was still
more surprised to see the manner in which he had treated
them. His competitor complained that the <cite>Standard</cite> had
assailed him for his vote some years ago as to the distribution
of the school fund. This was a mistake. The <cite>Standard</cite> had
never, to his knowledge referred to it at all. It may have
been done in some other paper, but his competitor would find,
as <em>he</em> had done in a former contest, that it was useless to
notice attacks of that kind. If he did, he would have his
hands full. But, from the course of his competitor, he rather
thought he was availing himself of this matter to get votes in
this section. He had made an elaborate argument to show
the gross injustice of the present mode of distributing the
school-fund, and had undertaken to show that the Democratic
party was responsible for it; that the original pledge for distributing
the fund had been violated; that the West had not
been true to her own interests, or she would have defeated
Governor Reid; and he had made a strong appeal to the people
here as a Western man.</p>

<p>Now, said Mr. Bragg, I claim not your support either as an
Eastern man or a Western man, but as one who intends to discard
all sectional questions, looking to the interests and wishes
of the whole State. But Mr. Gilmer is in error as to one
thing&mdash;the fund chiefly for common schools was not raised by
Mr. Yancey's bill, but came from the General Government as
part of the surplus revenue under General Jackson's administration.
Nor did the Democrats of 1842 introduce the
present mode of distribution by a repeal of any other law,
but it was done before that time&mdash;it was not a party vote, but
it was one about which there was difference of opinion and
contest without the slightest regard to party. Time and again
the matter was brought before the Legislature, but for several
years past the question had ceased to be raised. It was considered
as settled. In the last contest it was so considered
between him and his competitor, and he regretted that Mr.
Gilmer had deemed it proper to reopen it. It would do no
good; it would again lead to sectional strife; it would retard
the public improvements of the State, and nothing practical
would come of it, because experience had shown that it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
not be changed. It would even injure the common schools
which were now doing well and improving under the efficient
management of our State Superintendent. Governor Bragg
said that he had no wish to conceal his own opinions on this
subject. He was against disturbing the matter. He would say
so in the West; he would say so in the East. And now, said
he, turning to Mr. Gilmer, I want my competitor to state his
position. He has said a great deal about the matter, but has
not told you what he will recommend in case he should be
elected.</p>

<p>(At first Mr. Gilmer declined to answer, but before the
discussion closed he said that the opinions advanced by him
were his <em>private</em> opinions; but if elected Governor he would
not recommend any change, but would acquiesce in the
present law, whatever his own opinions might be.)</p>

<p>Then, said Governor Bragg, there is practically no difference
between us. But my competitor makes a public argument
in order to express his private opinions, and makes it in
such a way as he thinks will get him votes here. I hope, said
Governor Bragg, he will take the same course all over the
State.</p>

<p>As to free suffrage, Governor Bragg said that his competitor
professed to be a great free-suffrage man, but somehow
always voted against it. Formerly, we were told that it was
wrong to pass it by the Legislature; that it must be done by
a convention. That was the objection two years ago. He
had then told the people that it was idle to talk about a convention;
that the action of the several Legislatures for years
past had shown it to be so; that we must take things as they
are, and act accordingly. Now he would remind the people of
what he said, and would ask if it was not true, for, if they
would examine the journals of the last General Assembly,
they would find that the convention bill, when offered in the
Senate, received the votes only of some sixteen out of the fifty
members, and in the House of Commons never received, in
any of the different shapes in which it was offered, more than
forty out of one hundred and twenty members, thus showing,
conclusively, that there was a large majority&mdash;two to one&mdash;against
a convention in the Commons, in which house the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
West has a majority opposed to the call of a convention; whilst
upon the passage, in the same House, of the free-suffrage bill,
there were only fifteen votes against it, the members from
Cherokee and most of the mountain counties who had voted
for a convention voting for the bill. But his competitor, as
already stated, had in every case voted against the bill, and
says he is yet against it, unless an amendment offered by him,
or some other, could be adopted; and, as that cannot be done
now, the bill having passed through one Legislature, and to
amend it would be to destroy it, of course his competitor was
opposed to it. Governor Bragg said that the opponents of
this measure were always finding some objection to it. First,
it was to be done by an open convention, then by a restricted
convention, and now it seems his competitor falls back upon
an old objection always urged by those in favor of keeping
things as they are, that there is danger that the landed interest
would be burdened unduly with taxes. This was altogether
chimerical&mdash;such had not been the case in other States. It was
the largest and most powerful interest in the State, and members
of the Assembly could not do such a thing and sustain
themselves at home. Nor was it likely they ever would
attempt it, inasmuch as they themselves must be landholders,
and would suffer as well as other land proprietors. The thing
was preposterous. Let the freemen of the State, then, be true
to themselves, and the measure would be passed. But let them
be on their guard. Every effort will be made by open enemies
and pretended friends to defeat it.</p>

<p>As to the tempting bait held out to them of having cheap
courts and trials of petty offenses before justices of the peace,
and thus keeping such matters out of court, no one know
better than Mr. Gilmer that the Legislature had power to do
that without a convention; and if he thought it expedient, he
ought to have done it when in the Legislature.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Gilmer's bank notions, in relation to which he
wished to know Governor Bragg's opinion, he, Governor
Bragg, stated he should have it whenever he would set them
out with such plainness as to enable him to see what they
were.</p>

<p>His competitor made brave promises, however, to the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
that it would pay the interest on the State debt, and save
them from taxation. He would say this&mdash;he did not believe
that interest, debts, and taxes could be paid by any such legislative
<em>hocus pocus</em>. As to small notes, the Governor said that
the matter was not one of a party character; that he had no
wish to follow Mr. Gilmer into that discussion, as it would
consume all his time, and he much preferred to discuss what
the Know-Nothing platform called the "Paramount Principles
of Americanism"; and he would proceed to that after
saying a word as to Mr. Gilmer's idea that our State bonds
and the interest thereon should all be payable in North Carolina.
Had he seen as much of this matter as I have done,
said Governor Bragg, since I went into office, he would
change his opinion. He said it would all be well enough to
have our bonds paid here, if they could be sold here in sufficient
quantities. But our public works would have stopped
had they depended on sales in North Carolina, and our Treasurer
and railroad presidents would tell him so; and moreover,
that bonds payable here could not be sold in New York.</p>

<p>The Legislature had not taken the view of his competitor,
and he thought they had acted wisely.</p>

<p>Governor Bragg said that he thought that the allusion of
Mr. Gilmer to Mr. Fillmore and his execution of the fugitive-slave
law was exceedingly unfortunate. In that case the
negroes were allowed to be taken away from the United States
authorities and carried off. In the case of Mr. Pierce, Anthony
Burns, by the aid of the whole power of the Government
was returned to his owner.</p>

<p>His competitor talked a great deal about the peace and quiet
of Mr. Fillmore's administration, and charges Black Republicans
and Democrats with causing all the excitement and danger
of the existing troubles, and he stands upon a platform,
said Governor Bragg, which denounces the administration for
having recklessly and unwisely repealed the Missouri Compromise&mdash;a
pretty platform for a Southern man to stand upon,
especially when adopted in place of that of the year before.
He read from the speech of Mr. Badger to show that all the
Whig Senators from the South supported the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill, except one, and that the measure was passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Northern and Southern Democrats and Southern Whigs, and
that Mr. Badger said it was right and proper that it should
pass.</p>

<p>Governor Bragg then gave the history of the Missouri Compromise
line&mdash;showed how unjust it was to the South originally,
that the South had, however, shown every disposition
to abide by it, and had time and again sought to have it extended
over the new territory to the Pacific, while the North
repudiated that line. The South was, therefore, not properly
chargeable with any breach of faith, and was right to get rid
of the odious act. Now, he said, there were questions of vital
importance growing out of that matter, and he wished to know
where our Know-Nothing opponents stood with regard to
them. But no one could tell. What was Mr. Fillmore's
opinion upon any one of these questions? Nobody knew.
He had said nothing while at home, and at the last accounts,
strange as it might seem to Know-Nothing ears, he was in the
city of Rome partaking of the hospitalities of the Pope.
When the matter is pressed, we are told that the party
eschews all sectional questions, state and national, in order
that the "Paramount Principles of Americanism" may have
full play, thus raising the question only, who shall hold the
offices of the country, and not, in what manner our government
shall be administered. Can it be possible, said Governor
Bragg, that the people will be thus humbugged and
trifled with when the country is in danger?</p>

<p>Governor Bragg said he would then examine the claims of
this new party. He went into a full examination of its principles;
stated what had been its history North and South; what
had been its fruits in different sections; how it sent nothing
but abolitionists and freesoilers to Congress, and challenged his
competitor to point to one solitary Northern national man of
his party in either house of Congress; gave the history of the
election of Speaker of the House of Representatives, and how
not one of them voted for Aiken when the contest was between
him and Banks, although five of them had voted for him the
day before, including their candidate Fuller.</p>

<p>He then examined into its origin, and traced out the machinery
of the whole thing; showed that it was a monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
attempt to subvert the plan of government adopted by our
fathers, and to substitute in its stead these worse than midnight
Jacobin clubs. But I am unable to follow the Governor
through this part of his speech without too much prolixity.</p>

<p>He exposed their constitutions, rituals, obligations and
oaths, some of which he read. Said they had been hunted
from their dark places in this State, and now profess to have
done away with all this&mdash;how and in what way does not appear&mdash;while
at the North these councils, as appears from their
last national platform, are still kept up.</p>

<p>He concluded by saying that such a party did not deserve
support of a free people, nor did he believe they would receive
it. He was willing to go before the people of North Carolina
on this subject, and should do so confident of success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Cowper himself selected Governor Bragg's account of
the discussion above given as illustrative of his judicial fairness
of mind, and I have adopted it for all purposes. Of
course there is nothing in it to show Bragg's strength of intellect.
The discussion as reported is interesting, however,
as a side-light on those times.</p>

<p>Bragg was essentially a lawyer. His practical sagacity
and hard common sense, however, as well as his wide political
reading, made him a success both in politics and law, a rare
combination.</p>

<p>His speech in the Holden impeachment would give a better
idea of his talents, but it is too long for the scope of this
work; and all the facts and speeches of every trial should be
published together in justice to the accused.</p>

<small>BY MONTFORD McGEHEE</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>William Alexander Graham was born on the 5th day of
September, 1804, in the county of Lincoln. He was fortunate
alike in the race from which he sprang and in his own
ancestry. The race was that which, by a change of residence
from Scotland to Ireland, anterior to its immigration to this
country, acquired, as it were, a double nationality and name,
to wit: Scotch-Irish.</p>

<p>The ancestry of Mr. Graham were deeply imbued with the
spirit of this people. His maternal grandfather, Major John
Davidson, was one of the signers of the Mecklenburg
Declaration, and acted a conspicuous part in the Revolution.
The name of his father, General Joseph Graham, is one of
the best known in our Revolutionary annals. The biographical
sketch incorporated into <cite>Wheeler's History</cite> is a
brief but noble record.</p>

<p>His mother was distinguished for her personal beauty&mdash;distinguished
as well for her sense, piety and many amiable
virtues. But death deprived him of her fostering care before
he had attained his fourth year, and he was then consigned
to the care of an elder sister. The tender affection and
respect with which he always referred to this sister, attests
how fully she discharged a mother's duty.</p>

<p>He received the rudiments of his education in the common
schools of the country. He commenced his classical
education in the academy at Statesville, then under the care
of the Rev. Dr. Muchat, a scholar of good repute. Mr. Graham
verified the apparent paradox of Wordsworth,</p>

<p class="center">
"The child is father of the man."<br />
</p>

<p>He was noted, from his earlier years, for his industry, his
thirst for knowledge and his aptitude to learn. One who
knew him well testifies that from his childhood he was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
less remarkable for his high sense of truth and honor than
for his exemption from the levities and vices common to
youth. At this academy he applied himself to his studies
with the most exemplary diligence. A classmate at that
time says of him, "He was the only boy I ever knew who
would spend his Saturdays in reviewing the studies of the
week."</p>

<p>An incident which occurred about this time affords a
striking proof of his early force of character. General Graham
was a pioneer in a branch of industry yet but little
developed in this State&mdash;the manufacture of iron. Upon his
removal to Lincoln he established a furnace and forge, which,
at the time now spoken of, had become quite extensive.
From some cause the works were left without a superintendent.
The General installed his son William, though then
but a boy, and wholly without experience, at the head of
the establishment; and the energy and judgment with which
he conducted it, obtained his father's entire approval. He
was next sent to the academy at Hillsborough.</p>

<p>From this academy he went to the University of the
State, where he was matriculated in the summer of 1820.
His course throughout his college life was admirable in every
way. He appreciated the scheme of study there established,
not only as the best discipline of the intellect, but as the
best foundation for knowledge in its widest sense. He mastered
his lessons so perfectly, that each lesson became a permanent
addition to his stock of knowledge. The professors
rarely failed to testify by a smile, or some other token, their
approval of his proficiency. On one occasion, Professor Olmstead
(who has achieved a wide reputation in the field of
science) remarked to one of his classmates that his lecture on
chemistry came back as perfectly from Mr. Graham as he had
uttered it on the previous day.</p>

<p>Some thirty years after, the same professor in a letter to
Mr. Graham (then Secretary of the Navy) uses this language:
"It has often been a source of pleasing reflection to me, that
I was permitted to bear some part in fitting you, in early life,
for that elevated post of honor and usefulness to which Providence
has conducted you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>His high sense of duty was manifested in his conscientious
deportment under the peculiar form of government to which
he was then subject. His observance of every law and usage
of the college was punctilious; while, to the faculty, he was
ever scrupulously and conspicuously respectful.</p>

<p>His extraordinary proficiency was purchased by no laborious
drudgery. The secret of it was to be found in the precept
which he acted upon, through life: "Whatsoever thy
hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." His powers of
concentration were great, his perceptions quick, his memory
powerful, prompt, and assiduously improved. By the joint
force of such faculties, he could accomplish much in little
time. Hence, notwithstanding his exemplary attention to
his college studies, he devoted much time to general reading.
It was at this time, no doubt, that he laid up much of
that large and varied stock of information upon which he
drew, at pleasure, in after life.</p>

<p>Intent upon availing himself to the full, of every advantage
afforded him, he applied himself assiduously to the
duties of the Literary Society of which he was a member.
He participated regularly in the debates and other exercises
of that body. For all such he prepared himself with care;
and it is asserted by the same authority, to which I have
already referred&mdash;a most competent judge&mdash;that his compositions
were of such excellence that, in a literary point of
view, they would have challenged comparison with anything
done by him in after life.</p>

<p>His engaging manners brought him into pleasant relations
with all his fellow-students. He lived with them upon terms
of the frankest and most familiar intercourse. In their
most athletic sports he never participated, but he was a
pleased spectator, and evinced by his manner a hearty sympathy
with their enjoyments. His favorite exercise was
walking, and those who knew him well will recollect that
this continued to be his favorite recreation while health was
spared him. With his friends and chosen companions he was
cordial and easy, and always the life of the circle.</p>

<p>The class of which he was a member was graduated in
1824. It was the largest up to that time; and, for capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and proficiency, esteemed the best. It was declared by Professors
Olmstead and Mitchell, that Yale might well have
been proud of such a class. It embraced many who
afterward won high distinction in political and professional
life.</p>

<p>No one could have availed himself to a greater extent
than Mr. Graham did, of the opportunities presented in his
collegiate career. "His college life, in all its duties and obligations,"
says the gentleman before quoted, "was an epitome
of his career upon the stage of the world." He adds
that on the day when he received his diploma, he could, with
his usual habits of study, have filled any chair with honor
to himself and acceptance to his class. Such is the emphatic
testimony of one who himself graduated with high distinction
in the same class. Might we not subjoin, building upon the
above remark, that his career in after life was, in great part,
the logical result of the discipline and training to which he
submitted himself, so conscientiously, in his college life?</p>

<p>After graduation he made an excursion to some of the
western States, which occupied a few months. While at
Lexington, he heard Mr. Crittenden address the jury in a
great slander or libel case. The speech, which was worthy
of the great advocate's fame, made a profound impression
upon Mr. Graham. It may have had some influence in determining
his choice of a profession, or in fixing it, if already
made. From this tour he returned in 1824, and entered upon
the study of the law in the office of Judge Ruffin.</p>

<p>He obtained his County Court license in the summer of
1826. At August term of the court he appeared at the Orange
bar. The rule then required, between the admission to practice
in the County Court and the admission to practice in the
Superior Court, a novitiate of one year. This period he spent
in Hillsborough that he might continue to profit by the
instruction of his learned preceptor. At the end of the year
he received his Superior Court license. It was now a question
where he should establish himself for the practice of his
profession. The counties of Mecklenburg, Cabarrus and Lincoln
were filled with his blood relations, connections and
friends. They were among the most distinguished for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
wealth, intelligence and Revolutionary service. Their combined
influence would give him command of all the important
business of those counties, and place him at the outset
in the position of a leader of the bar. The prospect in
Orange and the adjoining counties was widely different. In
these latter counties he would have no adventitious advantages.
The business of these counties, moreover, was engrossed
by an able and a numerous bar. At the first court
which he attended after he obtained his Superior Court
license they mustered to the number of twenty-six. A large
proportion of these were young men recently admitted to
practice; but after deducting these, and many more of longer
standing and respectable position, there still remained a bar
which for learning, abilities and eloquence was never surpassed
in this State. Of resident lawyers there were Thomas
Ruffin, Archibald D. Murphy, Willie P. Mangum, Francis
L. Hawks and Frederick Nash; of lawyers attending the
court, from other counties, there were George E. Badger, William
H. Haywood and Bartlett Yancey. What recollections
of renown connected with the forum, the Senate, and the
church flood the mind as we recall these names! Fain would
I pause to contemplate the career of these illustrious men,
by which the character of North Carolina was so much elevated
in the consideration of the world, and so much of honor
brought to the State. But other subjects press upon me&mdash;subjects
of more immediate interest.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this formidable competition&mdash;a competition
which might well dismay one at the outset of professional
life&mdash;Mr. Graham resolved to fix his residence at Hillsborough.
Two reasons were assigned by him for this conclusion:
first, an unwillingness to relinquish the foothold he
had gained in the county courts of Orange, Granville and
Guilford; second, a reluctance to sever the associations
formed with his professional brethren at those courts. Another
reason, quite as potent, probably, was a well-grounded
confidence in his own abilities, and in his knowledge of his
profession. Against such men he entered the lists, and
against such he had to contend; not indeed all at the same
time, but all within a period of two years. It may be mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
as an instance of the vicissitudes of human life, that
five years from the August of that year&mdash;1827&mdash;not one of
those illustrious men remained at that bar.</p>

<p>His first case of importance in the Superior Court was one
which, from peculiar causes, excited great local interest. It
involved an intricate question of title to land. On the day
of trial, the court room was crowded and the bar fully
occupied by lawyers&mdash;many of them men of the highest professional
eminence. When he came to address the jury, he
spoke with modesty, but with ease and self-possession. His
preparation of the case had been thorough, and the argument
which he delivered is described as admirable, both as
to matter and manner. When he closed Hon. William
H. Haywood, who had then risen to a high position at the
bar, turned to a distinguished gentleman, still living, of the
same profession, and inquired who had prepared the argument
which Mr. Graham had so handsomely delivered. The
answer was, "It is all his own;" to which Mr. Haywood
replied with the observation, "William Gaston could have
done it no better."</p>

<p>Mr. Graham knew none of that weary probation which
has been the lot of so many able men. His argument in the
case just mentioned at once gave him a position of prominence.
It was not long before he attained a place in the
front rank of his profession. Here, with the large stores of
professional knowledge which he had laid up, it was easy to
sustain himself. His high mental qualifications, his habits
of study, his perseverance, his unalterable faith in his cause,
brought to him a constantly increasing business, and a constantly
widening reputation. He was early, for so young a
man, retained in the most important causes in the courts in
which he practiced, and his associate counsel generally gave
him the leading position in the trial.</p>

<p>In 1833 he was elected a member of the General Assembly
from the town of Hillsborough. His first appearance on the
floor has an interest from the relations subsequently existing
between him and the distinguished man to whom the motion
submitted by him had reference. He rose to move the
sending of a message to the Senate to proceed to the election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of a Governor of the State, and to put in nomination Governor
Swain. A day or two after he had the satisfaction of
reporting that that gentleman&mdash;who was ever afterward
united to him in the closest bonds of friendship&mdash;had received
a majority of votes, and of being named as first on the committee
to inform him of his election. He took, from the beginning,
an active part in the business of the House relating
to banks, law amendments and education.</p>

<p>I record an incident which attests the high consideration
which he had already acquired in the country, and the importance
attached to his opinion. Judge Gaston had been
elected in 1833 to a seat on the Supreme Court Bench by a
majority of two-thirds of the General Assembly. He had
been brought up in the Roman Catholic faith&mdash;the faith of
his fathers&mdash;the faith in which he died. The thirty-second
section of the old constitution declared incapable of holding
office all those who "deny the truth of the Protestant religion."
Some dissatisfaction had been expressed at his accepting
a judicial office under a constitution containing this
clause, which in the opinion of some, excluded him. For
some time he did not deem it necessary to advert to the
matter. In 1834&mdash;November 12&mdash;he addressed a letter to Mr.
Graham, enclosing a written paper, in which he stated succinctly,
but with great clearness and force, the reasoning by
which his acceptance had been determined. In the conclusion
of his letter he referred it to Mr. Graham's judgment, to
determine what degree of publicity should be given to the
paper. Whether it was ever published we do not know; but
when we consider Judge Gaston's high station and great
name in the country, and that the purity of that name was in
a measure at stake, the incident must be regarded as a singular
tribute to the character which Mr. Graham had thus
early established. It is well known how Judge Gaston
availed himself of his place in the Convention of 1835 to set
forth to the world the reasons by which his decision had been
influenced&mdash;reasons so cogent and conclusive as to satisfy
every mind. It is known, too, that the object of the great
speech delivered by him then&mdash;an object happily accomplished&mdash;was
to bring about such a modification of the obnoxious
clause as to deprive it of all sectarian intolerance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Graham was again a member from Hillsborough in the
year 1835. In the organization of the committees the post
of chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary was assigned
to him, and the journals bear testimony to the diligence with
which its duties were discharged. It was through him, in his
capacity of chairman, that the various reports of the commissioners
to revise the statute laws of the State&mdash;the <cite>Revised
Code</cite> being then in progress&mdash;were submitted to the House.</p>

<p>From the abilities displayed and the high position held by
him in the Legislature, we should naturally expect to find
him in the Constitutional Convention of 1835. It has been
well said that the county of Orange has been to North Carolina,
what Virginia has been to the Union, the mother of
statesmen. On this occasion, by one of those caprices which
sometimes seize upon communities as well as individuals, the
noble old county seemed to care little for her ancient renown.
There seems to have been no action by the county to secure
delegates worthy of her former reputation. We learn from
the remarks of one of the delegates in the Convention, that
there were ten candidates in the field, and that the successful
candidates were returned by so small a vote as to call forth
a taunt from a member of the Convention. In such a contest
Mr. Graham had no desire to enter the field; indeed,
whenever he offered himself for the suffrages of his countrymen,
it was as the chosen champion of the principles of a
great party.</p>

<p>He again represented the county of Orange in the Legislatures
of 1838 and 1840, in both of which he was elected
Speaker. This withdrew him from the arena of debate, and
we learn little more of him from the journals of those sessions
than the uniform punctuality and universal acceptability
with which he discharged the duties of that high
trust.</p>

<p>A revolution in the politics of the State brought about a
vacancy, in 1840, in the representation from North Carolina
in the Senate of the United States. Mr. Strange, under instructions,
had resigned his seat; the term of the other Senator
was near its end. There were thus two terms to be filled
by the Legislature of 1841. Mr. Mangum was elected for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the full term, Mr. Graham for the unexpired term. This
election was considered by Mr. Graham as the most emphatic
testimonial of the confidence and favor of the State
which he received during his life. Mr. Mangum and he were
residents of the same county, and of the many able men who
might justly advance claims to the other seat Mr. Graham
was the youngest. Certainly an election under such circumstances
constituted a tribute of peculiar significance and
value.</p>

<p>He was among the youngest members of the Senate when
he took his seat; but he soon commanded the esteem and
respect of the entire body. That, it has been truly said, was
preëminently the age of great men in American parliamentary
history, and of such he was regarded as the worthy
compeer. "He never rose to speak," says a distinguished
gentleman (Mr. Rayner), who was himself a member of Congress
at that time, "that he did not receive the most respectful
attention. When the Senate went into Committee of the
Whole he was usually called upon to preside. Reports from
him as chairman of a committee almost invariably secured the
favorable consideration of the Senate." From the same authority
we learn that the relations existing between him and
Mr. Clay were of the most kindly and intimate character, and
that Mr. Clay "regarded him as a most superior man, socially
and intellectually."</p>

<p>The period during which Mr. Graham was in the Senate
was one of the most stormy in our political annals. The
Whig party had just achieved a great victory, and Harrison
and Tyler had been elected by an immense majority. That
party reckoned confidently that it would now be able to carry
out those great principles of government, for which it had
so long contended, and which had been so signally approved
in the recent election. In the midst of these patriotic anticipations,
General Harrison died, and Mr. Tyler succeeded to
the Presidential chair. Mr. Tyler had adopted the platform
of the Whig party, and in his address, upon assuming the
duties of his high office, he did not intimate the least change
of policy from that which his predecessor had announced in
his inaugural. He had, moreover, retained the same constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
advisers. The statesmen of the Whig party now set
to work to redeem the pledges which had been made to the
country. A great financial measure was passed; this was
vetoed by the President. A second measure of the same
kind, framed in conformity to the views indicated in his veto
message, was passed, which was vetoed in like manner. A
tariff bill was passed, but this shared the same fate. Efforts
were made to pass these bills over the President's veto, but in
every instance the veto was sustained by the opposite party.
The result of these repeated disappointments was that all
hope of united and efficient action in carrying out the great
principles of the Whig party was finally abandoned.</p>

<p>The administration of Mr. Van Buren had largely exceeded
the revenues. Provision for this deficiency had to be made
by the incoming administration. To meet an emergency so
pressing a bill was introduced, known as the "Loan Bill."
It was strongly opposed, among others, by Mr. Calhoun, in a
speech of characteristic force and compass. So far as the
Whigs were concerned it was an appeal by the administration
for aid, to a party which it had betrayed. Mr. Graham
only recollected that the good of the country was involved,
and gave it his support. "I will not," said he, "stop the
action of the government by denying it the means of going
on, no matter who may be in power." The speech which he
delivered on this bill was eminently able and statesmanlike.
He demonstrated the necessity of the measure; he traced
out the cause of the deficiency, and pointed out the remedy.
The subject has little interest to the general reader at this
day, yet in that speech there are passages of such profound
reflection and philosophic scope as will give it a value to
the political student at all times.</p>

<p>When the Apportionment bill in 1842 was under consideration,
very strong opposition, headed by Mr. Buchanan, of
Pennsylvania, and Mr. Wright, of New York, was made to
the districting clause. Mr. Graham, on June the 3d, addressed
the Senate in support of the clause. In a calm, condensed,
weighty and conclusive argument, he demonstrated
that the district system of electing Representatives to Congress,
was in conformity to the true theory of representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
government, and was the one contemplated and expected by
the framers of the government; that it was sanctioned by
usage almost unanimous in the old States, and by the usage
of two-thirds of the new; that the general ticket system was
fraught with evils, public and private; nay, with dangers to
the Union. There was a passage in that debate which so
forcibly illustrates the high moral plane upon which he discussed
public affairs that I cannot pass it by. It was objected
by Mr. Woodbury, of New Hampshire, that if the act
were passed by Congress, it had no means of enforcing it.
He wished to know whether an armed force or a writ of
mandamus would be sent to the State Legislatures to compel
them to lay off the districts. In reply Mr. Graham showed
that if, notwithstanding the law, a State should return
members according to general ticket, the House of Representatives,
as judge of the election of its members, could
pronounce such election a nullity. "But the duties of the
States under our Constitution," said he, "are not to be determined
by their liability to punishment, but by the covenants
into which they entered by that instrument. It is
faith, honor, conscience, and not the 'hangman's whip,' on
which, at last rest the blessings of this noblest human institution
which has ever been devised for the security, the
welfare and happiness of man." In this exclamation, he unconsciously
announced those great principles by which his
own conduct through life was regulated, and to whose
slightest behest he ever yielded an unhesitating obedience.</p>

<p>A short time after&mdash;July 25, 1842&mdash;he received the following
letter from Chancellor Kent: "I thank you for your
speech on the districting clause of the Apportionment bill.
I have read it carefully, and I deem it in every respect logical,
conclusive, and a vindication of the power assumed by
the bill, in language clear and specific, tempered with due
moderation and firmness. The district system is essential to
check and control the cunning machinery of faction."</p>

<p>After the expiration of his term&mdash;March 3, 1843&mdash;Mr.
Graham resumed the practice of his profession.</p>

<p>In 1844 he was nominated by the Whig party of North
Carolina for the office of Governor. He had not sought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
nomination; nay, would have declined it if he could have
done so consistently with his high conceptions of the duty
of a citizen. In 1836 he had married the daughter of the
late John Washington, Esq., of New Bern, a lady of rare
beauty and accomplishments&mdash;a union which brought to him
as much of happiness as it is the lot of man to know. From
this union a young and growing family was gathering around
him. His patrimony had not been large, and the requirements
of his family demanded his constant professional exertions.
He was now at the summit of his profession, and his
emoluments would be limited only by the nature of the
business in an agricultural State, where commerce existed
to only a small extent, and manufactures were in their
infancy. His attention had been much withdrawn from his
profession during his senatorial career, and besides the expense
and loss of time in a State canvass, he would, if elected,
be entirely precluded from the exercise of his profession
during his term of office. The salary of the office was small,
and a residence in the capital as Chief Magistrate would
render necessary an increased scale of expense. On the other
hand were considerations of great weight. Letters came to
him from many gentlemen of high standing in various parts
of the State, pressing his acceptance by every consideration
that could be addressed to an elevated mind. Moreover, he
was not unmindful of the honors which had been conferred
upon him, and not ungrateful. He held, too, that the circumstances
must be very exceptional which could justify a
citizen in withholding his services when called to a public
station by the general voice of the people. To determine
his duty cost him much anxious reflection; but the latter
consideration proved decisive. The decision once made, he
acted with his accustomed energy.</p>

<p>His nomination was hailed with satisfaction throughout
the Union. Among other letters which he then received,
giving expression to this feeling, was one from Mr. Clay.
In conclusion he thus expressed himself: "Still, I should
have preferred that you were in another situation, where the
whole Union would have benefited by your services."</p>

<p>His opponent was Colonel Mike Hoke. He was born in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the same county with Mr. Graham, and was nearly of the
same age. He was a gentleman of fine person, of fine address,
of considerable legislative experience, and of high
position at the bar. The canvass was well contested on both
sides; on the part of Mr. Graham it was conducted with
surpassing ability. When it came to the vote he led his
competitor by several thousand majority.</p>

<p>He was inaugurated on the 1st of January, 1845, the oaths
of office being administered by Chief Justice Ruffin. The
<cite>Raleigh Register</cite> of that date remarks, that "the audience
which witnessed the ceremony, for everything that could
make the occasion imposing, has never been surpassed within
our recollection. The lobbies and galleries were crowded
with strangers and citizens, and a brilliant assemblage of
ladies."</p>

<p>His first term was so acceptable that he was elected to the
second by a largely increased vote. His two terms embrace
that period, during which North Carolina made the greatest
progress in all her interests. The messages of his very able
predecessor, Governor Morehead, followed up by his own,
drew the attention of the whole State to the subject of internal
improvements, and a powerful impulse was given to that
great interest.</p>

<p>In a letter, Mr. Webster writes as follows: "The tone
which your message holds, in regard to the relations between
the State Government and the General Government, is just,
proper, dignified and constitutional, and the views which it
presents on questions of internal policy, the development of
resources, the improvement of markets, and the gradual advancement
of industry and wealth, are such as belong to the
age, and are important to our country in all its parts." His
earnest recommendation of a geological survey elicited from
Prof. Olmstead, a letter commending his views expressed in
that regard, in which he said: "There is no State in the
Union which would better reward the labor and expense of a
geological survey than North Carolina."</p>

<p>In 1849 he delivered the address before the literary
societies at Chapel Hill. His subject was a cursory view of
the objects of liberal education. This address stands out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
wide contrast to those which have been customary on such
occasions, and is solid, sterling, practical. It is a vindication
of the University curriculum.</p>

<p>Public honors have been coy to most men; it was the
reverse in his case. They waited around him with perpetual
solicitation. In 1849, Mr. Mangum, one of the confidential
advisers of the President, wrote to Mr. Graham that he
might make his election between the Mission to Russia and
the Mission to Spain. Subsequently the Mission to Spain
was tendered to and declined by him.</p>

<p>Upon the accession of Mr. Fillmore to the Presidency, a
seat in the Cabinet was tendered to Mr. Graham. In the
letter addressed to him by the President, informing him of
his appointment, he said: "I trust that you will accept the
office, and enter upon the discharge of its duties at the
earliest day. I am sure that the appointment will be highly
acceptable to the country, as I can assure you, your acceptance
will be gratifying to me." In a letter couched in proper
terms, dated July 25, he communicated his acceptance.</p>

<p>In a letter dated the 19th of February, 1851, Mr. Benton
wrote as follows: "I have just read a second time, your
report on the Coast Survey. I consider it one of the most
perfect reports I ever read&mdash;a model of a business report, and
one which should carry conviction to every candid, inquiring
mind. I deem it one of the largest reforms, both in an economical
and administrative point of view, which the state of
our affairs admits of."</p>

<p>He resolved, being strongly supported by the President, to
send an expedition to Japan and bring that empire within the
pale and comity of civilized nations. The command was
assigned to Commodore Perry. The event showed what
statesmanlike sagacity was exercised in planning the expedition
and in the selection of its leader. Everything that was
contemplated was accomplished. The success of that expedition
constitutes one of the principal claims of Mr. Fillmore's
administration to the admiration of the country and of posterity.
Its success constitutes, indeed, an era in the history
of the world. Its results have been great and cannot but be
enduring. It has placed our relations with Japan upon a just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and honorable basis. It has given a new direction to much
of the commerce of the world&mdash;pouring its fertilizing tide
through the heart of the American continent. Its effects
upon Japan are but beginning to be seen; yet already they
exceed what would have been brought about in the ordinary
course of affairs in a thousand years. No people have ever
availed themselves of the light of a superior civilization as the
Japanese have. In that light they have seen the unfitness
of many of their old institutions and have abandoned them;
they have seen the unfitness of their language for foreign
intercourse, and are preparing to substitute the English language.
The changes thus made are harbingers of progress
which will justify the most lively anticipations for the future.
The friends of humanity and religion, especially, hail the
prospect with delight. They see in what has been already
done, the prospect of an entire change in the institutions of
that land. They hope, at no distant day, to see liberal institutions
introduced there. They hope to see a universal recognition
of popular rights, where the bonds of caste have been
so inexorable; to see equal laws take the place of a despot's
will, and to see the Christian religion again introduced, never
more to be disturbed in its peaceful reign.</p>

<p>Another expedition was sent out in 1851 under the direction
of the Navy Department. The object was the exploration
of the valley of the Amazon in the interests of commerce.
The instructions to Lieutenant Herndon&mdash;to whose
charge the expedition was confided&mdash;contained in the letter
of Mr. Graham, of February 15th, were full and particular.
They embraced the position of the country&mdash;the navigability
of its streams&mdash;its capacities for trade and commerce&mdash;and
its future prospects. In February, 1854, the report was
published by order of Congress. It contains the most ample
information upon all the points embraced in the instructions.
In the London <cite>Westminster Review</cite> of that year, it was
noticed with just credit to the author, and due recognition
of the enlightened policy which projected the expedition.</p>

<p>A part of the triumph of the compromise of 1850 belongs
to North Carolina. Her favorite statesman was then in the
Cabinet, and shared in the counsels by which these results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
were brought about. During the progress of these measures
he was in constant conference with their author, and to the
opinion of none did their author pay greater deference.</p>

<p>His labors as Secretary of the Navy were brought to a
sudden termination. The Whig party met in convention on
the 16th of June, 1852, and put in nomination for the Presidency
General Scott, and for the Vice-Presidency Mr. Graham.
Mr. Graham's preference for the Presidency was Mr.
Fillmore, and without a distinct declaration of principles,
and an approval of the course of his administration, he would
not have permitted his name to be placed on any other ticket.
This declaration was made, and in terms as explicit as he
could wish; with that declaration, it became a mere calculation
of chances which was the candidate most acceptable to
the country. Under these circumstances he accepted the
nomination. Immediately on his acceptance, with a view as
he expressed it, "to relieve the administration of any possible
criticism or embarrassment on his account in the approaching
canvass," he tendered his resignation. The President "appreciating
the high sense of delicacy and propriety" which
prompted this act, accepted his resignation with expressions
of "unfeigned regret."</p>

<p>In Mr. Stephens' history of the United States, it is said
that in accepting the nomination tendered him by the
Whigs, General Scott "cautiously avoided endorsing that
portion of the Whig platform which pledged the party to
an acceptance of and acquiescence in the measures of 1850."
If avoidance there was, it was because he deemed it unnecessary
to pledge his faith to measures with which he was so
intimately identified. He was acting Secretary of War during
the pendency of these measures. "No one," says Mr.
Graham in a letter to a friend, "more deeply felt the importance
of the crisis, or cooperated with us more efficiently
in procuring the passage of the compromise measure, or
rejoiced more heartily in the settlement thereby made." With
a soldier's sentiment of honor, General Scott rested on his
record, which was open to all the world. But the charge of
unfaithfulness to those measures was made against him, and
urged with fatal effect. And so it came to pass that the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
candidates who had exerted all their abilities, and used all
their influence, official and other, to secure the passage of the
compromise measures, were beaten upon the charge alleged
against one of them of unfaithfulness to those measures.</p>

<p>After his retirement from the cabinet, and in the same
year&mdash;1852&mdash;he delivered the sixth lecture in the course,
before the Historical Society of New York, in Metropolitan
Hall, in the city of New York. "The attendance," we are
told in the <cite>Evening Post</cite> of that date, "was exceedingly
numerous." Ever anxious to exalt his State, and set her
before the world in her true glory, his subject was taken from
the history of North Carolina. It was the British invasion
of North Carolina in 1780 and 1781.</p>

<p>It is known what scant justice has been done to our State
by the early historians of the country. This injustice Mr.
Graham, as far as a lecture would admit, undertook to redress.
Though his subject confined him to the events of less
than two years, and took up the story five years after the
first blood had been shed at Lexington, and four years after
the Declaration of Independence, he presents a rapid and
graphic sketch of what was done in North Carolina down to
the year 1780. He depicts the advanced state of opinion in
North Carolina before the war; he recounts the military
expeditions sent out by her in support of the common cause;
and shows that "from New York to Florida, inclusive, there
were few battle-fields on which a portion of the troops engaged
in defense of the liberties of the country were not
hers." He then places before us in strong colors, the period
just before Lord Cornwallis commenced his famous march&mdash;that
period so justly designated as the dark days of the
Revolution; when Georgia and South Carolina had been
over-run and subjugated; when the army of the South had
been nearly annihilated by the disastrous battle of Camden
and the catastrophe of Fishing Creek. He relates the bold
measures&mdash;measures which call to mind those of Rome, at
similar crises of peril&mdash;with which the State of North Carolina
prepared to meet the impending shock. He then enters
upon a narrative of the different operations of the American
and British armies under their respective commanders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Greene and Cornwallis, and a finer narrative it would be
difficult to point out. A bare recital of the incidents of that
campaign would not want interest in the hands of the dryest
historian, but in this narrative it is brought before us in
vivid colors. By his brief but striking delineation of the
principal actors; by his rapid touches in which the relative
state of the Whig and Tory population of that day is brought
to view; by his sketches of the scenery of the Piedmont
country&mdash;the theater of that campaign; by his notices of
individual adventure; above all, by his masterly recital of
the incidents of the retreat of General Greene and the pursuit
of Lord Cornwallis&mdash;a retreat in which the hand of
Providence seemed from time to time, so visibly interposed&mdash;the
grand procession of events passes before us with the
interest of an acted drama. We experience a feeling of deep
relief, when at length, the army of Greene is placed in safety.
After taking breath, which we had held as it were, during
the quick succession of events in that celebrated retreat, we
retrace our steps and the interest culminates in the battle of
Guilford. "The philosophy of history," says Mr. Benton in
his <cite>Thirty Years' View</cite>, "has not yet laid hold of the battle
of Guilford; its consequences and events. That battle made
the capture of Yorktown. The events are told in history,
the connections and dependence in none." The future historian
will find the task done to his hand in this lecture.
Its decisive character is there appreciated and set forth.</p>

<p>The lecture closes with some reflections on the "Act of
Pardon and Oblivion," passed by the Legislature, after the
proclamation of peace, at its first session in 1783. "An act,"
says Mr. Graham, "of grace and magnanimity, worthy of the
heroic, but Christian and forbearing spirit which had triumphed
in the struggle just ended." The words have a
peculiar and melancholy significance to us, who recollect
how long after the war, he stood among us as an alien and a
stranger, deprived of the commonest right of citizenship;
and how by mistaken party spirit he was debarred the enjoyment
of those senatorial honors, with which a grateful people
would have cheered and crowned the evening of his
life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>This lecture will, I think, be regarded as the maturest of
his literary efforts. It presents the events of the time of
which it treats in new combinations, and sheds upon them
new lights from original investigations. The style is always
clear, forcible and harmonious. Classic ornament is introduced
to an extent rare for him; for though he retained his
classical learning to the end of his life, his sense of fitness
led him to employ very sparingly what any one might be
disposed to attribute to ostentation. Altogether it is the
most valuable contribution yet made to the history of North
Carolina at that era. It sets the State in a juster light than
anything on record. It particularly commends itself to all
who cherish in their hearts the sacred flame of State love and
State pride; to all who hold in honor the renown of their
ancestry; to all who would catch</p>

<p class="center">
"Ennobling impulse from the past."<br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Graham was again a member of the Legislature in
1854-'55. The great question of that session was what was
popularly known as "Free Suffrage." Its object was to
abolish the property qualification for the Senate, and extend
to every voter the same right of suffrage, whether for the
Senate or the House. To this extension of suffrage <i>per se</i> he
made no objection. He contended, however, that the constitution
was based upon carefully adjusted compromises of
conflicting interests, and that an amendment of the constitution
confined to this single point&mdash;as it must necessarily
be if carried out by the Legislative method&mdash;would disturb
those compromises and thus destroy or greatly impair the
harmony of that instrument. He, therefore, advocated the
calling of a convention, that all the questions embraced in
these compromises might be duly considered, and other parts
re-adjusted to suit those which might be changed. These
views were presented in a speech, memorable for its ability.
In the former part he discusses the question at issue, and
here will be found some of the finest examples of his skill as
a dialectician; in the latter part he gave an exposition of
the subject in all its constitutional bearings&mdash;an exposition
learned, lucid and conclusive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The administration of Mr. Buchanan drew to its close
amidst signs ominous for the future tranquillity of the country.
These signs awakened the fears of all who loved and
valued the Union, and the trusted statesmen of the country
made arrangements to meet for conference, and to give expression
to their views. The executive committee of the
Constitutional Union party determined early in January,
1860, to issue an address to the people of the United States
upon the grave exigencies in national politics. A committee
of seven, all men of the highest national distinction, among
whom was Mr. Graham, was appointed to prepare the
address. Mr. Crittenden notified him of his appointment in
a letter of January 24th, and urged his attendance at the
meeting of the committee. In his answer, Mr. Graham had
left it doubtful whether the pressure of his engagements
would permit his attendance, and requested that another
might be appointed in his place. Accordingly Governor
Morehead was appointed. But Mr. Crittenden wrote again,
and to show the importance attached to his judgment and
action, I subjoin an extract from his letter: "The crisis is
important, and fills the public mind with expectation and
anxiety. It is earnestly to be desired that the character of
our convention should be conspicuous and equal to the occasion.
We have good reason to feel assured of the attendance
of many of the most eminent men of the country, and it is
by the great weight of the moral and public character of its
members that the convention must hope to obtain for its
acts or counsels, whatever they may be, respect and influence
with the people. We cannot do without your <em>assistance</em> and
<em>name</em>. All the members of the committee, who were present
when your letter was read, united in wishing me to write
and to urge your coming to the convention. Your absence
will be a positive <em>weight</em> against us."</p>

<p>A number of eminent statesmen, among whom was Mr.
Graham, met in Washington City, in February, to consult
together upon the dangers which menaced the country. The
result was the convention which nominated the Constitutional
Union ticket for the Presidency, in behalf of which he canvassed
the State. Upon the election of Mr. Lincoln he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
public addresses, and exhorted the people to yield due obedience
to his office.</p>

<p>But the tempest had long been gathering, and was now
ready to burst. No human power could avert it. The people
of South Carolina, and of the other States of the far South,
had been educated in the doctrine of secession, and there
were few in those States who did not hold that doctrine as
an undeniable article of political faith. The time was come
when this doctrine was to be tested. The election of Mr.
Lincoln constituted the cause in the minds of the people of
South Carolina. On the 20th of December, 1860, that State
held a convention, and declared her connection with the
United States dissolved, and proceeded to put herself in an
attitude to make good her declaration. In this action she
was followed by States to the south of her, and on similar
grounds.</p>

<p>The doctrine of secession met with little favor in North
Carolina. As a right deduced from the Constitution, and to
be exercised under its authority, it was believed by Mr.
Graham, and the school of statesmen to which he belonged,
to be without foundation. The Legislature of North Carolina
directed the question of a convention to be submitted to
the people. The question was discussed, in the light of
recent events, by the press of the State, and numerous meetings
of the people were held in every part. These meetings
were addressed by our ablest men. Amongst these a monster
meeting was held at Salisbury, which was addressed by
Governor Morehead, Mr. Badger and Mr. Graham, who, as
well for the exalted positions they had held as for their commanding
abilities, were looked to for counsel in this emergency.
The people at the polls pronounced with great unanimity
against a convention.</p>

<p>But events were marching on with rapid strides. On the
13th of April, 1861, Sumter surrendered to Confederate guns.
On the 15th, Mr. Lincoln issued his call for 75,000 troops.
This call was made without authority, and was the first of
that series of public measures culminating in the unauthorized
suspension of the "Habeas Corpus Act" on the 10th of
May, under the shock of which the public liberties of the
North for a time went down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>By these events the aspect of things was wholly changed.
The question of secession as a right, whether the election of
Mr. Lincoln was a just cause for the exercise of that right or
not, had drifted out of sight. War was inevitable. Virginia
had followed the example of the Southern States, and North
Carolina was now girdled with seceded States. All that was
left her was a choice of sides. The language of Mr. Graham
at this crisis was the language of all thoughtful men; nay,
it was the language of the human heart. And looking back
upon all that we have suffered&mdash;and there are none, even in
the Northern States, but say we have suffered enough&mdash;if a
similar conjuncture were to arise, the heart would speak out
the same language again. Speaking the voice of the people
of North Carolina, as he, from the high trusts confided to
him in his past life, and from the confidence always reposed
in him, was, more than any other, commissioned to do, in a
public address at Hillsborough, in March, 1861, he expressed
himself as follows:</p>

<p>"Ardent in their attachment to the Constitution and the
Union, they had condemned separate State secession as rash
and precipitate, and wanting in respect to the sister States
of identical interests; and as long as there was hope of an
adjustment of sectional differences, they were unwilling to
part with the Government, and give success to the movement
for its overthrow, which appeared on the part of some, at
least, to be but the revelation of a long cherished design.
But the President gives to the question new alternatives.
These are, on the one hand, to join with him in a war of
conquest, for it is nothing less, against our brethren of the
seceding States&mdash;or, on the other, resistance to and throwing
off the obligations of the Federal Constitution. Of the two,
we do not hesitate to accept the latter. Blood is thicker
than water. However widely we have differed from, and
freely criticised, the course taken by these States, they are
much more closely united with us, by the ties of kindred,
affection, and a peculiar interest, which is denounced and
warred upon at the North, without reference to any <em>locality</em>
in our own section, than to any of the Northern States."</p>

<p>Under the influence of these counsels, so wisely and temperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
expressed, a convention of the people of North Carolina,
was called. On the 20th of May, a day memorable in
the annals of the State and of the world, the convention
passed the ordinance of secession.</p>

<p>For this ordinance the vote was unanimous. But though
the vote indicated an entire unanimity among the members,
it was unanimity only as to the end to be accomplished.
The views of Mr. Graham, and the statesmen with whom he
acted, had, in regard to secession as a constitutional remedy,
undergone no change. To set forth their views, Mr. Badger
offered a series of resolutions in the nature of a protestation&mdash;an
exclusion of a conclusion. These resolutions asserted
the right of revolution, and based the action of the convention
on that ground; but the minds of men had been wrought
to such a pitch of excitement that the distinction was unheeded,
and the resolutions failed.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June the convention passed the ordinance
by which the State of North Carolina became a member of
the Confederacy. To this measure Mr. Graham offered a
strong but fruitless opposition. In the perilous career upon
which we were about to enter he was unwilling to surrender
the sovereignty of the State into the hands of those whose
rash counsels had, in the judgment of the people of North
Carolina, precipitated the war. He wished the State to hold
her destinies in her own hands, that she might act as exigencies
might require. Those who realize the delusive
views under which the government at Richmond acted during
the last months of the war will see in this opinion another
proof of his wise foresight.</p>

<p>The progress of the war which now broke out with such
fury demonstrated that there were here, as at the North,
those who conceived that the public peril had merged the
constitution and the laws. Early in the session "an ordinance
to define and punish sedition and to prevent the dangers
which may arise from persons disaffected to the State,"
was introduced.</p>

<p>On the 7th of December Mr. Graham addressed the convention
in opposition to this ordinance. The speech which
he delivered on this occasion was, perhaps, the noblest effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of his life. It breathes the true spirit of American freedom.
It is the product of a mind deeply imbued with the great
principles of civil liberty, and which had devoutly meditated
upon all those safeguards which the wisdom of successive
generations had thrown around it. His wide acquaintance
with history had made him familiar with every device by
which liberty may be sapped and undermined; his exalted
estimate of its value and dignity had developed this acquaintance
into a special sense by which he could detect any
design hostile to it, under any pretense or subterfuge, however
specious or skillful.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the war the current of power set
steadily from the Confederate States to the Confederate
Government; and with each year of the war, the current
flowed on with increasing tide. Within its just bounds, no
man yielded a heartier allegiance to that government than
Mr. Graham; but on the other hand, no man stood ready to
oppose a firmer resistance when that government overstepped
those bounds. The war had been begun and was then prosecuted
for the maintenance of great principles, and it was his
fixed purpose that civil liberty should not, at the South as at
the North, be engulfed in its progress. In the year 1862 a
minister of the gospel&mdash;a man of learning and of irreproachable
character&mdash;was arrested in the county of Orange, under
a military order, sent to Richmond, and cast into prison. He
was not in the military service of the Confederate States,
and therefore not amenable to military law. As a proceeding
against a citizen, such an arrest, without charge made
on oath and without warrant, was in violation of all law;
while his deportation beyond the limits of the State, for trial
by military tribunal, was in contempt of the dignity and
sovereignty of the State. Mr. Graham, being then Senator
from Orange, introduced a resolution demanding a return
of the prisoner to the State, which was passed at once. On
introducing the resolution, he expressed the opinion that the
proceeding was without the sanction of the Confederate
Executive, or of the Secretary of War. The sequel proved
this supposition to be correct. The prisoner was sent back
with a disavowal of any knowledge of the proceeding on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
part of the President or the Secretary, until the confinement
of the prisoner in the military prison at Richmond. The Secretary
frankly admitted the erroneous nature of the arrest
and imprisonment, and disclaimed all intention to interfere
with the rightful jurisdiction of the State. On the 22d of
January, 1863&mdash;upon the incoming of the message with the
accompanying documents, touching the case&mdash;Mr. Graham
paid a merited tribute to the enlightened comprehension of
the relations existing between the Confederate Government
and the States, evinced by these sentiments, and in the further
remarks submitted by him, he took occasion to re-state the
great principles of personal liberty&mdash;daily more and more
endangered in the course of the war&mdash;and to impress them
upon the public mind by apt comments upon the case to
which the public attention was then so strongly directed.
This was the first, and is believed to have been the last case,
in which military power was used to override civil law.</p>

<p>In December, 1863, Mr. Graham was elected to the Confederate
Senate by a majority of two-thirds of the Legislature.
He took his seat in May, 1864. There was then need of the
best counsel. The brilliant successes which had crowned
our arms in the early years of the war, had been replaced by
a succession of disasters. The battle of Gettysburg and the
fall of Vicksburg had brought us apparently to the brink of
ruin. As the year 1864 rolled on, the prospect became
darker and darker, and at the end of the year the situation
was to the last degree critical. Our territory had been cut
in twain, and we were beleaguered by land and by sea.
Within the area which acknowledged the Confederate Government,
there was great exhaustion of all kinds of military
supplies, and a like exhaustion of all the elements for the
support of human life. General Lee was only able to oppose
the front of General Grant by extending his line until it was
ready to snap from excessive tension. To strengthen his
force from the white race was impossible; conscription there
had reached its limit. General Sherman had swept through
Georgia, and the broad track of desolation which he left
behind him too truly told the story of our helplessness. It
was known that each Confederate soldier was opposed by as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
many as five Federal soldiers; the former scantily fed, clothed
and shod; the latter supplied with every comfort and many
luxuries. (The odds were seven to one, says <cite>Stephens' History
of the United States</cite>.) It was plain there was no longer
any hope of a successful prosecution of the war. In the midst
of a dense gloom which shrouded the country on every side,
a ray of light dawned in the proposed peace conference at
Hampton Roads. Mr. Graham had endeavored to reach this
form of intercourse from the commencement of the session.
He was not without hope of a peaceful termination of hostilities;
not so much from his estimate of the statesmanship of
President Davis and his Cabinet, as from the extremity of the
case which left no other alternative. The conference took
place on the 3rd of February, 1865. The terms offered by
Mr. Lincoln were, that the seceded States should return to
the Union under the Constitution, in the existing state of
affairs, with slavery as it was, but liable to be abolished by
an amendment to the Constitution. He pledged himself to
the utmost exercise of the executive powers in behalf of the
South. The demand of the Commissioners was for independence.
There could be no middle ground, and the conference
ended. Upon the return of the Commissioners, Mr.
Davis and Mr. Benjamin made public speeches in Richmond,
to fire the Southern heart anew; but the event proved how
little sagacity they brought to the direction of affairs at that
supreme hour. The speeches fell still-born. [French intervention
in Mexico was the South's opportunity; Seward's object
in the Hampton Roads Conference was to ascertain if
Southern statesmanship knew how to play its advantage.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i>]</p>

<p>One principle had actuated Mr. Graham from the beginning
of the war; to sustain the Government in its struggles
for independence until it should be demonstrated that our
resources were inadequate for that end; and when that
should be seen and acknowledged, to seek, if possible, a
peaceful solution. How well he sustained it is matter of
history. He sustained it in every way in which his talents
and his means could be made available. He sustained it by
his counsels in the State and in the Confederate Government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
He sustained it by blood more precious in his eyes than his
own&mdash;all his sons, five in number, who had attained the age of
eighteen, entered the army, and were in the army to the end.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of our resources, particularly of the population
from which our soldiers were drawn, had now been
demonstrated. It was known to Congress; it was admitted
by General Lee in his proposition to conscribe slaves; it was
proclaimed from the steps of the Capitol by Mr. Benjamin:
"Unless the slaves are armed," he said, "the cause is lost."
Every expedient had been tried; the extremest measures had
been put in operation; "by means of conscription, impressment
laws, and the suspension of the <i>habeas corpus</i>, the whole
population, and all the resources of the country, had long
before been placed at the command of the President for prosecution
of the war." All had been found unavailing.</p>

<p>One resource, in the opinion of some, remained&mdash;the conscription
of negroes. A bill for this purpose was introduced
into Congress. It was opposed by Mr. Graham upon the
ground that it was unconstitutional, as well as inexpedient
and dangerous. His sagacious mind saw that this was a
measure, not of safety, but a measure born of the wild promptings
of despair. On the 21st of February it was indefinitely
postponed, though it was subsequently taken up and passed.</p>

<p>If ever negotiation was to be resorted to, it was clear the
time had come. We know but little of what passed in the
Confederate Congress at that time. Its proceedings were had
in secret session; nor is it now known whether the journals
of the body escaped destruction. All that we know is derived
from what was published by the members after the fall
of the Confederate Government. Among these publications
is a paper contributed by Mr. Oldham, then Senator from
Texas, to <cite>DeBow's Review</cite>, in October, 1869, which gives us
some information of the proceedings of the Senate at that
time. A few days after the conference at Hampton Roads,
he informs us, a committee consisting of Messrs. Orr, Graham
and Johnson, was appointed to confer with the President,
and ascertain what he proposed to do under the existing
condition of affairs. In a few days they made a verbal
report through Mr. Graham. "Among other things," I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
quote Mr. Oldham's words, "they stated that they had inquired
of the President his views and opinions in regard to
proposing to the United States to negotiate for peace upon
the basis of the Confederacy returning to the Union, and
that he had answered that he had no power to negotiate a
treaty upon such a basis; that his authority to make treaties
was derived from the Constitution, which he had sworn to
support and that such a treaty would operate as an abrogation
of the Constitution, and a dissolution of the government;
that the States alone, each acting for itself, in its
sovereign capacity, could make such a treaty. Mr. Graham
said, he gave notice that he would, in a few days, introduce
a resolution in favor of opening negotiations with the United
States upon the basis of a return to the Union by the States
of the Confederacy; that he did not give the notice at the
instance or under the instruction of the committee, but upon
his own responsibility. The notice was received in such a
manner that he never offered his resolution."</p>

<p>I never saw the paper from which the foregoing quotation
is made, and was a stranger to this passage of Mr. Graham's
life until within the last forty days. I read it with a feeling
of profound relief. I have ever regarded him from my
earliest years, with the warmest admiration and the most
affectionate respect; but his failure, as I thought, to take
some action looking to peace after the Hampton Roads conference&mdash;when
the plainest dictates of humanity so clearly
demanded it&mdash;left upon my mind the painful impression
that he had been wanting to himself in that, the most important,
crisis of his life. There is a deep-seated conviction
that the blood which was shed after that conference might
have been saved. That the waste of the fruits of past centuries
of toil&mdash;a waste which consigned so many of the
present and future generations to want and misery&mdash;might
have been avoided. It is with gratitude I reflect that not a
tittle of responsibility for this bloodshed and waste lay at
his door. And when the inevitable hour came to him, I
doubt not the thought that he had done what he could to
arrest a war attended with such terrible and useless sacrifice,
was one of the sweetest reflections of his whole life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Congress adjourned about the 16th day of March. Impressed
with the imminence of the emergency, Mr. Graham
stopped but one day at home&mdash;that day being the Sabbath&mdash;and
on Monday proceeded to Raleigh to confer with the
Governor. The conference was long and earnest. Mr. Graham
laid before the Governor the views of the President,
the state of the armies, and earnestly recommended that the
Legislature should be convened. He sustained his advice
by the opinion of General Lee, and that of many good and
able men with whom he had been associated. He ended
by telling him that Richmond would fall in less than thirty
days, and that event would be followed probably by a rout
or dispersion of General Lee's army for want of food, if for
no other cause. The Governor was surprised by his statement
of facts, and incredulous in some degree as to his conclusions.
He agreed to consider the subject, and convened
the Council on that day week. Hearing nothing of their
action, in a few days Mr. Graham visited Raleigh again.
The Governor informed him that on the day appointed, a
bare quorum of the Council attended, and being equally
divided, he had not summoned the Legislature. He said
that Mr. Gilmer, with whom Mr. Graham had advised him
to consult, had suggested to him to solicit an interview with
General Sherman on the subject of peace. Mr. Graham
remarked that if such an interview were held, Mr. Davis
should be apprised of it. To this the Governor at once
assented. Mr. Graham suggested further that if that course
were taken, he (the Governor) should be in a condition to
act independently of the President, and convene the Legislature.
To this proposition the Governor manifested reluctance;
but finally agreed to call the Council of State again.
But while negotiation halted, the march of General Sherman's
army decided events. In a few days no resource was
left but an unconditional surrender. With the part borne
by Mr. Graham at that trying time, a gifted authoress of
North Carolina has made the public already familiar in the
captivating pages of her work, <cite>The Last Ninety Days of the
War</cite>.</p>

<p>There is no part of Mr. Graham's life in which the calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
wisdom, for which he was so distinguished, shone more conspicuously
than in the closing months of the civil war. When
independence was demonstrated to be hopeless, he sought
peace; but even then, only in channels admitted to be in
accordance with the great principles of our government.</p>

<p>In his opinion, that peace ought to be sought by the State
after the failure of the conference at Hampton Roads, he
was sustained by our entire delegation in Congress, and a
large proportion of the leading citizens of the State. Yet
so anxious was he not only to avoid any appearance of conflict
among the Confederate States, but to conform to all
that the most punctilious deference for the Confederate Government
might require, that he did not move in the matter
until after a conference with the President, and then only in
the track pointed out by him. The President disclaimed all
power of making a treaty, which would abrogate the Government,
and declared that the "States alone, each acting in
its sovereign capacity, could make such a treaty." In the
line of action here indicated the State could not be put in a
false position; nay, her honor would be put beyond all cavil.
It was known that we had no power to arrest General Sherman's
march. General Johnston confronted him, and all felt
convinced that whatever his great military genius could accomplish
would be done. But it was also known that his
gallant army was outnumbered six to one. A surrender in
a few days would be inevitable. Burning capitals, desolated
homes, famine and destruction of life, followed Sherman's
march. Was it not worth the effort to put a stop to such
frightful calamities? What Mr. Graham urged was that the
people might be allowed to determine their fate for themselves.
Such a course was in strict conformity to the fundamental
principles of our Government. A convention of seven
Governors had precipitated the war when peace counsels
seemed to be in the ascendant. Was not Mr. Graham justified
in the opinion that executive powers which had been so
destructively exerted in the beginning, might be beneficently
exerted in the end?</p>

<p>In an address delivered by Governor Vance before the
Southern Historical Society, at White Sulphur Springs, West
Virginia, August 18th, 1875, occurs the following statement:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soon after the failure of the Fortress Monroe or Hampton
Roads conference, I was visited by Governor Graham
(whose death we so recently deplore) who was then a Senator
of the Confederate States. After giving all the particulars
of that conference which had not appeared in the
papers, and the prevailing impressions of congressional circles,
about Richmond, etc., he informed me that a number of
leading gentlemen there, despairing of obtaining peace
through Mr. Davis, and believing the end inevitable and
not distant, had requested him to visit me and urge me, as
Governor of North Carolina, to take steps for making separate
peace with Mr. Lincoln, and thus inaugurate the conclusion;
that he agreed to lay their request before me without
promising to add his personal advice thereto. I asked
who those gentlemen were, and, with some reluctance, he
gave me their names, chiefly Senators and Representatives
in the Confederate Congress. I asked why these gentlemen
did not begin negotiations in their own States with the
enemy, and if they would come out in the papers with this
request to me. He said they could not take the initiative,
they were so surrounded at home, and so trammeled by
pledges, etc., as to render it impossible! I declined the proposition
of course."</p>

<p>It is with reluctance that I advert to this statement. Had
it been given to the press with a sponsor less entitled to consideration,
I should have been disposed to let it float with
the tide. But it presents itself under imposing circumstances;
it proceeds from one who, at the time referred to,
was at, the head of the government in North Carolina; it is
contained in an address made before a society whose object
it is to preserve the memorials of that time. The statement
thus passes into history. It will not be waived. It peremptorily
challenges attention.</p>

<p>[Mr. McGehee here enters into a rather labored argument
to show that Vance was mistaken; it would have been sufficient
simply to have published Graham's letter to Swain,
written shortly after the conversation, and therefore a better
exponent of what actually took place. It appears that Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
as Confederate Senator had far better means of knowing
the real condition of the Confederacy than Vance had, and
he, doubtless, as was his duty, gave him the whole truth.
Even without the vindication of his letter, I should be very
slow to believe that he ever advised Vance on his own responsibility
to undertake separate negotiations with the enemy.
For the consideration of a matter so delicate, serious, and dangerous,
doubtless, he, as well as Vance, would wish the assembled
wisdom of the State. And what he really advised, as
his letter shows, was to call the Legislature together, so that,
in secret session, upon full information, it might consider if
the State and the several States of the Confederacy should
as States make any propositions to the enemy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<p>After the Hampton Roads conference he had no longer
any hope of a peaceful solution through the action of President
Davis; from thenceforth he turned his thoughts to the
accomplishment of the same end through the action of the
States. The subject is often recurred to, but not an intimation
can be found of any plan, except that of the States acting
in conjunction. Very soon united action on the part of
all became an impossibility; conquering armies had dismembered
the Confederacy&mdash;had left indeed but two States that
could act in concert. But his plan still embraced these two.
March 26th, he writes as follows to Governor Swain: "I
went to Raleigh to have an interview with the Governor on
the subject-matter referred to in your letter. The result
was a convocation of the Council of State to assemble to-morrow.
The Legislature of Virginia has taken a recess
until the 29th instant, and I think it very important that
that of North Carolina should be in session as early as possible.
The war is now nearly reduced to a contest between
these two States and the United States!" In his letter of
the 8th of April, which contains, as I think has been shown,
the true account of the interview between Mr. Graham and
Governor Vance, Mr. Graham says: "I told him I should
attend the session of the General Assembly, and, if desired,
would address them in secret session; that I had confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
conversations with a committee of the Virginia Legislature,
which had taken a recess for ten days, and that it was important
to act in concert with that body."</p>

<p>The surrender left the State under the control of the Federal
generals and under the military law. According to
the theory of the administration, all civil government had
ceased; all the offices were vacant. The government, for a
time, was such as a conquering army administers in a subjugated
country. At length, to inaugurate a civil government
the precedent for the admission of territories was partially
adopted. A provisional Governor was appointed with
power to call a convention. In execution of his powers the
Governor made appointments to the vacant offices and issued a
call for a convention. Mr. Graham was nominated for the
convention; but it being announced by the executive, that
persons unpardoned would not be allowed to take their seats,
he withdrew from the canvass.</p>

<p>A constitution&mdash;the old constitution with some alterations&mdash;was
adopted. Mr. Graham opposed its ratification. From
his action at this time many of his best friends dissented.
They admitted with him that a convention called, not by
the people, but by a power <i>ab extra</i> and under limitations
of suffrage unknown to the constitution, was an anomaly in
American institutions. But certain changes were regarded
as inevitable after the war, and, if the administration, then
wielding supreme power over us, should rest satisfied with
the changes thus made, it was conceived by them to be the
wiser course to raise no question as to the manner in which
the convention was called. But in Mr. Graham's view many
of the ablest men in the State concurred, and the constitution
was defeated. Certainly it seems more in accordance with
the spirit of a great patriot to make continual claim, even if
ineffectual, in behalf of the principles of government established
by our fathers. Any mitigation which an abandonment
of those principles might have obtained would have
been but temporary; the principles themselves were for all
time.</p>

<p>The Reconstruction measures were now passed. The former
government was swept away. The whole power over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the question of suffrage, that question which lies at the
foundation of all representative government, and which,
under the old constitution belonged to the States, save that
Congress might pass uniform naturalization laws, was assumed
and exercised by Congress. Suffrage was adjusted
upon a new basis; all the black race was enfranchised, and a
large portion of the white race was disfranchised. Under this
adjustment, a new convention was called, and a new constitution
adopted, the constitution under which we now live.</p>

<p>These measures, so extreme in their nature, were regarded
while they were yet in progress by a large part of our people
with a feeling little short of consternation. The government
seemed wholly changed; the constitution irrevocably
wrenched, if not destroyed. A profound apathy fell upon
the minds of the people. A vast number ceased to take any
cognizance of public affairs. They seemed to regard them,
as removed forever beyond their control. In this state of
things a convention of the conservative party of North Carolina
was called. It met on the 5th of February, 1868, in
Tucker Hall, in the city of Raleigh, and was presided over
by Mr. Graham, who made the principal speech of the occasion.</p>

<p>The effect of this speech cannot be estimated. It aroused
the people from their despondency; it animated them to new
efforts; it went further, it infused into them the spirit with
which the speech itself was instinct. From that day the
Conservative-Democratic party dates its existence in this State
as a regularly organized party; within a short time thereafter
it gained possession of the Legislature and has held it to the
present time.</p>

<p>The Convention of 1865 had directed that the Legislature
should be convened. An election was accordingly held and
the Legislature met in the winter of that year. Mr. Graham
was unanimously elected for the county of Orange, but,
being unpardoned he did not offer to take his seat. It was
the universal desire of the people that he should represent
the State in the Senate of the United States, when restored
to its old relations. It was felt that North Carolina had no
one more competent to vindicate her action or represent her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
interests. It was felt that she had no one who, by his
balanced judgment, his temperance of feeling, his urbane
bearing, would do more to mitigate the asperities which had
been provoked by civil strife. He was elected by a large
majority. Upon his election he repaired to Washington and
presented his credentials. They were laid upon the table.
He presented to the Senate a manly and respectful memorial;
but he was never permitted to take his seat. The spectacle
presented by the exclusion from public affairs of a man
of his antecedents, while so many who had an active agency in
bringing on civil strife had been promoted to high station,
arrested attention everywhere. Many of the most eminent
men in the Northern States used their best efforts for the
removal of his disabilities, without effect. Political persecution,
set on foot by parties in his own State, pursued him
until it was placed beyond all human probability that he
should ever enjoy the honors for which the State had destined
him. When that had become a certainty, to wit, in
1873, his disabilities were removed. What reflections arise,
as we recur to this passage of his life! Mr. Graham had
clung to the Constitution until the rising tide of secession
had flowed around and completely insulated his State; to
this ancient ark of our fathers he again clung when after the
war the waves of political enthusiasm inundated the country
and the constitution. Yet he was left stranded, while
many of those who had fanned the tempests of both found
secure anchorage. But we look beyond to-day. The things
seen are temporal in more senses than one. The impartial
tribunal of posterity rises up before us. Then, when the
actors of to-day are weighed in even scales; when the influence
of passion and prejudice is unknown, then will the consistent
devotion to principle, by which his conduct was always
actuated, receive its due meed of admiration and applause.</p>

<p>In the year 1875&mdash;upon the 4th of February&mdash;he presided
over a meeting held in Charlotte to take steps for the proper
celebration of the centennial of the Mecklenburg Declaration
of Independence. Some writers of ability had seized upon
that event, and in that spirit of historical skepticism so
rife in our days, had undertaken, out of a few minor discrepancies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to deny the genuineness of the Declaration, or that
any meeting was held on the 20th of May. Mr. Graham had
been often solicited to place that event upon its proper basis.
He had heard it often talked of at his father's fire-side; he
knew all the traditions connected with it; he had known and
talked with many of the subscribers of that declaration; he
was well acquainted with public opinion regarding it, in that
section where the event occurred, down to the date of its
publication in 1820. For a long time motives of delicacy,
growing out of his connection with some of the principal
actors, restrained him. But at that time, all the actors had
passed away; they could no longer be heard; and a just regard
for their fame urged his acquiescence. He embodied his vindication
in the form of an address which he delivered on this
occasion. No fair synopsis of that address is possible; it is a
solid, compact argument which would be greatly impaired by
any attempt at abridgment. Let it suffice to say that the evidence
is arrayed in the spirit of the philosophical historian,
and with the skill of a lawyer. It will not put to silence the
mere caviller; no amount of evidence will, on this or any
other subject; but the candid inquirer will rise from its
perusal with the conviction that few events in history rest
upon a firmer foundation than the Mecklenburg Declaration
of Independence.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham left behind many literary essays, but none
which were prompted by mere desire for literary distinction.
His efforts of this kind were all the result of passing events;
all the fruit of hours snatched from an absorbing profession.
Yet if collected together they would form a considerable volume;
and if we consider their contents they give a high idea
of the intellect which could find its relaxation in such labors.
The dominant feeling of his life was loyalty to the State and
her institutions; hence the subjects usually selected by him
were drawn from her history.</p>

<p>Among these was a lecture delivered at Greensboro, in
1860. The citizens of that section of country, of which
Greensboro is the centre, contemplated the erection of a
monument to commemorate the services of General Greene
in the Revolutionary struggle. This lecture was delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
in aid of the enterprise, and embraced a life of Greene and a
history of Revolutionary events in this State. A copy was
solicited for publication, but from some cause it was never
published. It remains in manuscript, full and entire, as if
prepared for the press. Here may be mentioned two Memorial
Addresses&mdash;the one upon the life and character of Hon.
George E. Badger, and the other of Hon. Thomas Ruffin.</p>

<p>This record would be most imperfect did it fail to bring
into the most prominent relief the services of Mr. Graham
in his office of trustee of the University. He regarded the
University as the best ornament of the State, and no one of
all its sons nursed it with a more devoted or wiser care. He
attended all its commencements, and was most active in watching
over all its interests. No one labored with more zeal
for its restoration to the control of the true sons of the State.
For many years he was a member of the executive committee,
and at the time of his death he was the chairman of that committee.
It was to him, finally, that Governor Swain, in the
last years of his successful administration, looked for direction
and support in all its trials and embarrassments.</p>

<p>"It is not unusual for men of eminence," said Judge
Story, "after having withdrawn from the bar to find it difficult,
if not impracticable, to resume their former rank in
business." Mr. Graham experienced no such difficulty.
Though often called from his profession to public station, at
the first court at which he appeared after his term of office
expired, he was retained in all important causes, and business
flowed in upon him thenceforth as if he had never been
absent. In common with all the people of the South, his
resources had been somewhat impaired by the war, and
when civil government was restored he resumed the practice
of his profession with more than his wonted ardor. He
returned to all the courts of his former circuit, the business
of which had greatly increased by the general settlement of
all previous transactions which took place after the war.
The business of the circuit and district courts&mdash;both of which
he regularly attended&mdash;had been greatly enlarged by the
new system of revenue laws and other changes introduced
by the war, but, above all, by the bankrupt laws then recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
enacted. These with appeals to the Supreme Court
of the State, and appeals to the Supreme Court of the United
States, increased his labors, protracted his absences from
home, and left him few intervals for repose. It was felt by
his friends that he was overtaxing his strength by these
great exertions, but there was no abatement of his energies
until about a year before his death. Symptoms then appeared
which inspired deep apprehensions. It seemed but
too certain that disease had fixed itself upon some of the
great organs of life. He now gave up attendance upon
courts, but still watched over the progress of his causes, and
labored in the preparation of briefs&mdash;the causes themselves
being argued by his son, Maj. Graham. He was preëminently
a worker and he continued to work to the end. At
length the symptoms became more distressing, and he repaired
to Philadelphia to consult the eminent physicians of that city.
The result confirmed the opinion before entertained that his
malady was disease of the heart. Upon his return home he
continued his labors in his office. It was only under physical
exertion that his malady gave him trouble; when in repose
he was capable of as great mental efforts as ever.</p>

<p>At this period of comparative inaction that fortunate destiny
which presided over his life was constant to him still.
The pain, which was incident to his malady, was only felt
at intervals, and then was not severe. Apart from this,
there was every possible compensation. Besides the department
of professional labor still left to him, he had the
boundless resources of literature, ancient and modern, which
in the busiest periods of his life he had always cultivated
and justly prized. Every day, moreover, brought to him in
the visits of friends, or through the mails, in newspapers and
letters, some new testimonial of esteem and regard, public or
private. But above any and all of these, he could now enjoy
without interruption those pleasures, in which, amidst his
most brilliant successes, he ever found his chief happiness, the
pleasures of home and its sweet endearments.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham had been nominated by acclamation by the
people of Orange for the constitutional convention which sat
in September, 1875, but the state of his health rendered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
impossible for him to undergo the labors of the canvass. This
was not needed on his own account, but his absence from the
hustings was regretted on account of the convention cause.
He published, however, a strong address to his constituents;
which was widely circulated, and had an important influence
on the result.</p>

<p>A meeting of the commissioners to determine the boundary
between Virginia and Maryland had been arranged to take
place at Saratoga Springs, in the State of New York, in
the month of August, 1875. Thither Mr. Graham accordingly
went, accompanied by Mrs. Graham and his youngest
son. For many days he appeared to be in his usual
health; but a great change was at hand. After an evening
spent with his friends, whose society he enjoyed with
more than his wonted zest, he retired a little beyond his
accustomed hour. Soon after the symptoms of his disease
recurred in aggravated form. Physicians were summoned
who ministered promptly, but ineffectually. Meantime
the news of his situation spread, and messages of inquiry
and offers of personal services testified to the general and
deep concern. But all that science and the most affectionate
solicitude could suggest proved unavailing. He expired at
6 o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, the 11th of August,
1875.</p>

<p>It had long been believed, by those who knew him best,
that Mr. Graham was at heart a Christian. It is with inexpressible
gratification, I am able to add, that when approached
on this subject during the last days of his life, he freely expressed
his hope of salvation through our crucified Redeemer.</p>

<p>The intelligence of his death was transmitted by telegraph
to every part of the country. All the great journals responded
with leading articles expressive of the national bereavement.
Numerous meetings were held&mdash;meetings of the
bar, meetings of citizens, meetings of political opponents, for
political enemies he had none&mdash;to give their estimate of the
illustrious deceased, and to speak their sense of his loss. The
States of Virginia and Maryland, with that high sense of delicacy
which marks all their public acts, took care that the
remains of one who had stood in such honored relations to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
each, should be conveyed with due honor across their
bounds. At the borders of our State they were received by a
committee appointed by the bar of Raleigh, by a committee
appointed by the mayor and common council of that city, and
by a committee from Hillsborough, and were conveyed by
special train to Raleigh. There they were received by appointed
committees&mdash;by the Raleigh Light Infantry, by the
Raleigh Light Artillery (of both of which companies he was
an honorary member), by the United States troops from Camp
Russell, and accompanied by a great concourse of the citizens,
conveyed to the capital. There the remains were deposited
in the rotunda, which was draped in mourning for the occasion.
Late in the afternoon of the same day they were conveyed
with similar ceremonies to the central station. From
thence, attended by the Raleigh companies, and by special
guards of honor, appointed by cities and towns of the State,
and by the family of the deceased, they were conveyed by
special train to the station at Hillsborough. From thence
they were escorted, with the addition of the whole population
of the town, to his mansion, where they lay in state till the
noon of Sunday, the 15th. At that hour they were conveyed
to the Presbyterian Church, and, after appropriate
funeral services, were interred with solemn ceremony, amid
an immense concourse, gathered from many counties, in the
graveyard of that church.</p>

<p>The place which will be awarded him in the rank of orators
will not be the highest. Indeed at oratorical effects,
purely as such, he never aimed. There is no doubt but that
he might have employed the resources of oratory, other than
the very highest, to a much greater extent than he did. All
who have heard him in capital trials, and on other occasions
when great interests were at stake, were persuaded that he
possessed reserved resources of this kind to which he did not
give play, and which he could have called into requisition
at will. That he refrained was matter of deliberate judgment.
He preferred to address himself to the understanding.
He relied wholly upon argument, disdaining the adjuncts
of mere rhetoric. He knew that the triumphs of reason
are more durable than those which are the offspring of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
excited feeling. Reaction and change follow the latter; the
former leave full, permanent conviction.</p>

<p>As a parliamentary speaker and as an advocate he stood
in the first rank. His style was that which finds so much
favor among eminent English statesmen, that style in which
the results of thought and research are given with the warmth
and ease of animated and unpremeditated conversation.</p>

<p>In addition to his high intellectual endowments, nature
had to him been profuse in external gifts. In person he was
the ideal of the patrician. His features, regular and classic
in their outline, would have satisfied a sculptor. The habitual
expression of his face was one of blended thought, refinement
and quiet will. His form was noble and commanding; cast,
indeed, in nature's finest mould. These advantages were set
off by a dress always scrupulously neat, and sufficiently conformed
to the prevailing mode to escape observation. The
advantages, thus slightly touched upon, were singularly calculated
to impress favorably the mind of any audience. If
we add that he appeared before every audience with the
prestige of a character, which calumny itself would own to be
without a blemish, the causes of his uniform success are easy
to discern.</p>

<p>He possessed in many respects the temperament of a great
commander. As difficulties thickened around him his courage
seemed to rise, and his resources to develop. No man
ever fought a losing cause with more courage and constancy.
When in important cases the tide of testimony unexpectedly
turned and flowed dead against him there was nothing in
his look or manner that betrayed the change. His attention
would be redoubled, but in all else there was so much of calm
composure that lookers-on, inattentive to the evidence, have
left the court house under the impression that he would gain
the cause. He preserved, under all circumstances in the trial
of causes, the lofty tenor of his bearing. He was never betrayed
into an altercation with witnesses. It may be that
awe of his character, and a consciousness of his practiced
sagacity and penetration constrained witnesses, when in his
hands, to an unwonted utterance of the truth. This impression
may have been assisted, and probably was, by the fairness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and integrity observable in his whole bearing. But whatever
the cause, it is certain he never resorted to boisterous tones or
a browbeating manner. Equally removed was his manner
from all the arts of cajolery. In his examination of the most
refractory witness his mien was calm, his look observant and
penetrating, his voice never or but slightly raised above its
ordinary tone. In such a contest, the contest between acute,
disciplined reason, and cunning or obstinate knavery, the victory
was always on the side of the former.</p>

<p>In his moral constitution he was complete on every side.
All his conduct in life was regulated not only by the highest
sense of honor, but by the most scrupulous sense of duty. This
supreme sense of duty in everything that he did, whether
great or small, was his distinguishing characteristic. From
his cradle to his grave not a shadow of a shade ever rested
upon him. Esteeming a stainless character as the highest of
all earthly possessions, he exercised the most scrupulous caution
in his judgment of others. Few men were more often
in the public arena. He took part in all the political canvasses
of his time; in many of which partisan feeling was inflamed
to the highest pitch. Yet he never assailed the motives
of his opponent and never left any feeling of personal
injury rankling in his bosom. He always contended for principle,
and disdained to use any argument which reason would
not sanction.</p>

<p>In debate he was a model of candor, and whoever might
be his opponent he would always accept Mr. Graham's statement
of his position. In all his intellectual conflicts, whether
at the bar, on the hustings or in the Senate, under no provocation
was he ever excited to an unseemly exhibition of temper.
"Although," said a gentleman of high distinction, who
knew him long and well (Hon. S. F. Phillips), "I have been
present at the bar, and upon other public occasions when he
must have been greatly tried, I have never seen his countenance
degraded by an expression of passion. His look may
at times have been stern and high, but at all times it could
with advantage have been committed to marble or canvas."</p>

<p>It was the opinion of that eminent lawyer, Archibald
Henderson, that public men should mingle much with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
people&mdash;that there is to be found the true school of common
sense. Either because he held the same opinion, but more
probably from inclination, his intercourse with the people
was constant and cordial. When in attendance on his courts
it was his custom when the day was fine to repair, after the
adjournment of court, to the portico of his hotel, or the lawn
in front of it, and sit for an hour or two. This was often
his custom after the evening meal, usually served in his
circuit at hours primitively early. Here he became the
centre of a group of citizens all of whom he received with
courtesy. The talk on such occasions was free and general;
and, whatever the topic, he listened to their views with attention,
and in turn frankly gave his own. Thus his information
in regard to all matters of general interest was minute and
particular. It was thus, too, that he became informed as to
the current opinion in regard to public men and public measures.
This intimate knowledge of the people was one of the
great sources of his strength; it rendered his judgment of the
probable fate of State and national questions of great value.
His judgment upon such matters, in the counties in which his
circuit lay, was almost infallible.</p>

<p>In his social relations Mr. Graham was one of the most
attractive of men. Few had so wide a circle of friends, or
friends so attached. His manner to all men was urbane; to
his friends cordial and sincere. There was, except to a very
few, and at times even to them, a shade of reserve in his
manners; but there was nothing of pride; nothing expressive
of conscious superiority. There was great dignity, tempered
by unfailing courtesy. Perhaps this tinge of reserve made
his subsequent unbending the more agreeable. In his social
hours, in the long winter evenings at court, with the circle
gathered around the blazing hearth&mdash;it is as he was then
seen that his friends love best to recall him. For many years
there met together at one of his courts a number of gentlemen
of high intellectual gifts and attainments. These were Hon.
Robert Gilliam, Hon. Abram W. Venable, the present Judge
of the Seventh Circuit, and others less known. With such
men there was no need that any limitations should be imposed
on the conversation. Except in the field of exact science they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
were very much at home in all. The conversation ranged
wide, law, cases in court, history, biography, politics&mdash;largely
interspersed with anecdotes&mdash;formed the topics.</p>

<p>The moral dignity of man never received a higher illustration
than in the life before us. We admire the pure
patriot in whose thoughts the State&mdash;her weal and her glory&mdash;was
ever uppermost; the learned jurist who, from his ample
stores informed, moulded the laws of his own commonwealth;
the eloquent advocate who stood always ready to
redress the wrong, whether of the individual or the community
at large; the wise statesman who swayed the destinies of his
State more than any of his generation. But we render the
unfeigned homage of the heart to him, who by the majesty
of his moral nature, passed pure and unsullied through the
wide circle of trials and conflicts embraced in his life; and
who, in his death, has left a fame that will be an incentive
and a standard to the generous youth of North Carolina
through all the ages that are to come.</p>

<p>The foregoing sketch is the main body of a memorial address
on the "Life and Character of Governor Graham,"
delivered in Raleigh before the bench and bar of the Supreme
Court, June 8, 1876.</p>

<p>Much of it has been omitted; for, while it was a labor of
love (and there is much labor in it), it is too long for the
scope of this work. If Mr. McGehee's power of condensation
had been equal to his zeal and to his admiration and knowledge
of Governor Graham's life and work this memorial
would have been monumental.</p>

<p>As it stands now in its original form, or even as abridged in
this book, in spite of some just criticisms which could be
made against its style and method, it is an example of industry
to those who seek to collect and preserve the facts which illustrate
the lives of distinguished North Carolinians.</p>

<p>Who now, after the lapse of twenty years, could and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
write this life? Who has done a similar service in respect to
the lives of Mangum, Pearson, and others perhaps equally
worthy?</p>

<p>Mr. McGehee's sketch is, however, rather a panegyric. No
great man needs to be bolstered up with compliments, and
praise cannot preserve mediocrity from oblivion.</p>

<p>Nothing better illustrates the defects of Southern education
than the glittering generalities with which we would whitewash
our distinguished dead&mdash;as if they needed it&mdash;or as if
flattery could "soothe the dull, cold ear of death." We must
show, rather than say, our great men are great, and for this
purpose works are more effectual than words. By their fruits
ye shall know them.</p>

<small>BY ED. GRAHAM HAYWOOD</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>A great lawyer, a cherished and distinguished citizen having
fallen in our midst, in obedience to an honored custom, we
turn aside from the ordinary pursuits and ambitions to pay
this sad tribute to our illustrious brother.</p>

<p>Bartholomew Figures Moore having passed the age allotted
to man by the Psalmist, in the midst of his friends and kindred,
departed this life in the city of Raleigh, November 27, A. D.
1878. He was the son of a Revolutionary soldier, and born
at the family residence near Fishing Creek in Halifax county,
January 29, 1801.</p>

<p>Having prepared himself for college, he entered the University
of the State in 1818, and in 1820 graduated with
honor in a class of recognized ability.</p>

<p>Leaving the University, Mr. Moore read law with Hon.
Thomas N. Mann, an able and distinguished lawyer of Nash
county. After obtaining his license he entered upon the
practice of his profession at the then flourishing village of
Nashville, the county seat. His success for some years was
not by any means flattering, yet the first five hundred dollars
he received from his professional services he expended in traveling
and familiarizing himself with his country.</p>

<p>In December, 1828, he married Louisa, a daughter of
George Boddie, Esq., of Nash county, who lived only until
the 4th of November, 1829. In April, 1835, he married
Lucy W., likewise a daughter of George Boddie, who, having
witnessed and shared his toils and triumphs, survives him,
blessed with a large and estimable family.</p>

<p>He returned, in 1835, to Halifax, his native county, and
while pursuing his profession, was elected successively to the
House of Commons from 1836 to 1844, with the exception of
1838, when he was defeated in consequence of having voted
to give State aid to the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Company, of which he was a warm friend and an able advocate.</p>

<p>He was appointed Attorney-General of the State in 1848,
and, upon the convening of the General Assembly in December,
elected to the same position. This office he continued to
hold and fill with great acceptability until he resigned it in
consequence of being appointed a commissioner to revise the
statute law of the State. To him was assigned the principal
labor of arranging the matter and superintending the publication
of the <cite>Revised Code</cite>.</p>

<p>While ample success crowned his professional career in Halifax
county, yet in 1848 he removed to Raleigh, where he
resided till the time of his death. Bringing with him his well-established
reputation for research and ability, he continued to
command an extended and lucrative practice in this and other
parts of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore early secured a high reputation as an able and
profound lawyer by an elaborate brief in the celebrated case
of the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Will</i>, a slave (<cite>1 Devereux and Battle's Law</cite>).
It was a case that awakened a general and profound interest
throughout the country and settled the true relations between
master and slave in our State. It recognized the right
of the slave to defend himself against the assaults of his
master in the preservation of his own life. It is reserved to
but few of the profession to so impress their views upon the
courts, in advance of public opinion, and to prepare so admirable
a collocation of the law and to establish so durable a
reputation upon any one case.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore was a close and painstaking student; reluctant to
appear in any case without careful preparation; yet when he
entered the combat, the rich and fertile resources of his well-stored
mind clearly manifested that nothing rusted in his
intellectual armory.</p>

<p>His mind was logical, his manner forcible, his ideas, without
undue ornamentation, were clothed in strong and graphic
language. He seized at once the strong points of his case,
and pressed them with skill and sagacity. Possessed of a
strong mind and robust constitution, he was a fine exemplification
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in corpore sano</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>In politics he was a Whig, and admired a strong and stable
government; an ardent lover of civil liberty, he watched with
jealousy all legislation tending to encroach upon the guaranteed
rights of the citizen.</p>

<p>A bold and avowed Union man, while the States were
engaged in an unremitting and unrelenting civil war, his high
character and recognized integrity secured him, even amidst
the clash of arms, a respectful hearing, for it was known that
he sympathized with his own people in their unequal conflict,
and that often his hasty expressions were the result of deep
convictions. Recognized as a pronounced and outspoken
Unionist, it was but natural that he should be sought for and
consulted by the President of the United States at the termination
of the war.</p>

<p>His respect, however, for the constitutional limitations of
the General Government compelled him to oppose the whole
reconstruction policy, for he was incapable of yielding to the
intrigues of the politician or the subservient traffic of a mere
placeman.</p>

<p>He was a leading member of the State convention called by
the President, and ably advocated the adoption of all such
measures as were proclaimed as indispensably necessary to a
rehabilitation of the State, believing that wise statesmanship
required an early submission to the demands of the General
Government.</p>

<p>Reared in a conservative school of politics, and devotedly
attached to his State and the high character of her judiciary,
he ever looked with distrust upon the election of judges for
short terms and by popular ballot as an alarming inroad.</p>

<p>As a citizen, to the poor he was liberal and unostentatious,
to his equals, frank and manly, to all, kind and just.</p>

<p>That he had his faults, none will deny; he was impatient
of contradiction, at times impetuous and irascible, yet these
were but the natural emotions of an ardent and sanguine temperament,
and while they tended to obscure, did not infect
those true and excellent qualities which lay beneath the surface.</p>

<p>He lived literally within the Augustan age of the profession
in our State. With a Gaston, Daniel, and Ruffin on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
bench, the logical and versatile Badger, the strong and rugged
Saunders, the able, astute Haywood and their illustrious compeers
as rivals at the bar, it is praise enough to say that he
was ever equal to the emergency of any occasion.</p>

<p>He was the wisest man I ever knew. At his decease and
almost for his whole life, though filling only a private station,
he had come to be recognized as a distinct and efficient moral
power in regulating the social and political welfare of the
State. He lived almost to the utmost limit of the span
allotted by the Psalmist to man. Satisfied with only some
very brief honorable rest in extreme old age, he spent all
these years of his life in active, unremitting, assiduous labor,
and finished his career without a taint upon his honor or a
stain upon his reputation. His life covers many epochs in our
State and national history, and among them, the most solemn
and imperative political crisis through which State and nation
have yet passed. For forty years he was a leader in the legal
profession, and for perhaps a quarter of a century he was the
very head of the bar&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facile princeps</i>. Of all the gentlemen
who composed the Raleigh bar, when I was first admitted to
practice, he was the last relict&mdash;Badger, the two Busbees,
Husted, Jones, Manly, Mariott, Miller, Rogers, Saunders,
Sheppard, are all gone, sunk down&mdash;down with the tumult
they made!</p>

<p>His thorough and life-long devotion to the enforcement of
the laws preserving civil liberty, distinguished him among his
fellows. No circumstances of danger&mdash;no allurements of
ambition&mdash;no fear of consequences&mdash;no regard for himself,
his family, his fortune, his future&mdash;no specious arguments of
expediency ever tempted him upon any occasion to refrain
from boldly and perseveringly, in public and in private, urging
and enforcing his objections, whenever, wherever and in
whatsoever form the liberty of the humblest citizen was
threatened or invaded.</p>

<p>For solid wisdom, penetrating foresight, invariable sagacity,
he had no peer, and he has left behind none like him. He
had nothing but observation, reason and a sense of duty to
guide him, and these he obeyed under trials and temptations
which it is to be hoped, for the sake of public virtue, are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
to become common. In the presence of such manly, unselfish,
heroic virtue, I uncover my head and put the shoes from off
my feet and lift up my heart to God in thankfulness for the
example of this His faithful soldier and servant. According
to his lights he did his duty&mdash;a hard and painful duty it was,
and the event has proved that his lights were as true as the
sun in heaven. Every man is to be judged, so far as human
judgment is to be passed upon him at all, by the tenor of the
motives which actuated him, and to which the main current
of his life responded. Judged by this standard his course
with reference to the late social war must command admiration
even of those who most earnestly condemned his action.</p>

<p>I do not think Mr. Moore had genius, but his talents were
great, his will imperative, his industry unbounded, and his
habit of methodical and exhaustive analysis unequaled. He
had no great oratorical gifts, except to those cultivated minds
to which lucidity of arrangement and logical presentation of
a subject are most pleasing and convincing. Even his voice
when addressing an audience was harsh and unmusical. But
he was the most successful lawyer we had, and I remember
watching his mode of managing a cause with admiration and
wonder, and studying it, as the most perfect model within
my reach. In this respect his professional skill and acumen
were, and to the very end continued to be, unapproachable.</p>

<p>On a more favorable occasion it is to be hoped that some
person well qualified for the task will lay before the profession
a full, critical and careful history and examination of
some of the numerous great causes in which he appeared and
his arguments therein; in one or the other of which, as I
verily believe, is exhibited every variety of intellectual excellence
demanded for the elucidation and application of law
in the courts of justice. His briefs in the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Will</i>,
<i>Moye</i> vs. <i>May</i>, and <i>Walton</i> vs. <i>Gatling</i> are all models; each
one has its distinct method and discloses a special excellence.</p>

<p>During the period I knew him, which extended through a
quarter of a century, I never knew him to make a mistake
of judgment. I do not mean that he never, upon some passing
matter, erred in act or opinion, but in great crises when
the waters of revolution were out and the files of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
experience furnished no precedent for guidance&mdash;when all
was on the hazard and he was called upon to use his wisdom in
suggesting the best means applicable to the production of the
best results, in predicting what results must follow from one
course of action or another&mdash;he was almost infallible&mdash;his
predictions were prophecies. His bare opinions had come to
have in this community the weight of actual knowledge.
"He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon
his like again."</p>

<p>And in this connection let me say one word of a single episode
in Mr. Moore's career, with which I have heard some
thoughtless persons find fault. I speak of his well known hostility
to secession and the Confederate cause. Surely those who
impute blame to him have not considered his motives, his opinions,
his conduct. Mr. Moore was by conviction a Federalist,
both in politics and in the construction which, as a lawyer, he
gave to the Constitution of the United States; he denied
always, from first to last, the right of secession; he thought the
only safety for his people, for the State, for the nation, for
civil liberty even, was in the perpetuation of the Union; with
his far-seeing intellect he knew and foretold the fierce struggle
to come, the bloodshed, the evil passions, the crime, the
suffering which would accompany it, its failure, the dreadful
consequences, the perils to all civil liberty and all rights of
person and property which would result, many of which are
not yet past. He made no secret of his opinions and his feelings
at any time&mdash;he was constant, in season and out of season,
in proclaiming them from the housetops, and in endeavoring
to convert others to his views; to him the result&mdash;the
failure&mdash;was always present in all its shocking and useless
reality; and when the good opinion of his neighbors and
friends (which he cherished as much as any man) was at stake,
and his liberty, his future, his reputation, his very life, was on
the hazard of a die&mdash;he yet stood steadfast as the Northern
Star&mdash;"Of whose true, fixed and resting quality there is no
fellow in the firmament."</p>

<p>Which of his faultfinders would have done as much under
like circumstances? Which one of us, I pray you, oh! hot-blooded
secessionists, Hebrew of the Hebrews, if we had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
his prevision, would have obeyed the dictates of our convictions
and have exhibited such courageous virtue?</p>

<p>But, in my opinion, the <cite>Revised Code</cite> is the greatest monument
he has left of the excellent and rare endowments of his
mind; especially does it illustrate his profound knowledge of
the written law of North Carolina at the date of its preparation.
Lord Coke said of Littleton's treatise on <em>tenures</em>, "I affirm,
and take upon me to maintain, against all opposites whatsoever,
that it is a work of as absolute perfection in its kind, and
as free from error, as any book that I have ever known to be
written of any human learning"; and I venture to adopt his
language as applicable to the <cite>Revised Code</cite>. Its great and
surpassing excellence can only be fully perceived and appreciated
by those who have studied it, and have long had occasion
to apply it practically. They will have seen that it is
far more than a bare compilation of statutes&mdash;far more than
a codification of existing acts of Assembly, but that it has
amended and perfected every such act in those particulars in
which it has been proved by experience to be imperfect. It
indicates a profound and exact knowledge of every principle
which had been established, and every decision which had
then been made by our courts, and an exhaustive, methodical
analysis of the fundamental principles of the common law.</p>

<p>Having carefully arranged his affairs, and provided for the
wife and children whom he loved, and disposed of his great
estate, he retired to his chamber and folded his mantle about
him to die as he had lived, with decency. Weary and worn, perhaps
disappointed, certainly disenchanted, disillusioned of all
the bright dreams of his green manhood&mdash;let us follow him
there: be ye sure that sacred chamber was not haunted by
memories of evil deeds, of sins that had sorrowfully come
home at nightfall&mdash;with hopes that had borne no fruit,
with resolves abandoned almost as soon as formed. His
strength failed him more and more; painlessly he sinks into
the lethargy of approaching death, while his children gather
around his couch. What are the last feeble syllables which
they hear from the dying lips of this gray-haired veteran&mdash;"I
am tired now. I am going to my mother in Heaven."</p>

<p>Perhaps he knew that there were some heavy items underscored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
against him, but he also knew that the mercy of God
can even outdo the hope He gives us for token and keepsake.
A greater and a grander end, after a life of mark and power,
might, to his early aspirations and self-conscious strength, have
seemed the bourne intended. If it had befallen him&mdash;as but
for himself it would have done&mdash;to appear more actively in
official life, where men are moved by ambition and bold decision,
his name would have been more famous in history&mdash;but
perhaps also better known to the devil. As it was, he lay
there dying, and was well content. The turbulence of his
life was past, the torrent and the eddy, the attempt at fore-reaching
upon his age, and the sense of impossibility, the
strain of his mental muscles to stir the "great dead trunks
of orthodoxy"&mdash;and then, the self-doubt, the chill, the depression
which follow such attempts, as surely as ague tracks
the pioneer&mdash;thank God, all this was over now&mdash;the violence
gone&mdash;and the dark despair. Of all the good and evil things
which he had known and felt, but two yet dwelt in the feeble
heart&mdash;only two still showed their presence in his dying eyes
and words. Each of these two were good&mdash;if two indeed
they were&mdash;faith in the Heavenly Father, and love of the
earthly children.</p>

<p>"When the young are stricken down, and their roses nipped
in an hour by the destroying blight, even the stranger can
sympathize, who counts the scant years on the gravestone, or
reads the notice in the newspaper corner. The contrast forces
itself upon you. A fair young creature, bright and blooming
yesterday, distributing smiles, levying homage, inspiring desire,
conscious of her power to charm, and gay with the natural
enjoyment of her conquests&mdash;who, in his walk through the
world has not looked on many such a one; and, at the notion
of her sudden call away from beauty, triumph, pleasure, her
helpless outcries during her short pain, her vain pleas for a
little respite, her sentence and its execution, has not felt a
shock of pity? When the days of a long life come to their
close, and a white head sinks to rise no more, we bow our own
with respect as the mourning train passes, and salute the
heraldry and devices of yonder pomp, as symbols of age, wisdom,
deserved respect, merited honor&mdash;long experience of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
suffering and action. The wealth he has achieved is the harvest
he has sowed; the title on his hearse, fruits of the field he
bravely and laboriously wrought in. Around his grave are
unseen troops of mourners waiting; many and many a poor
pensioner trooping to the place; many weeping charities; many
kind actions; many dear friends beloved and deplored, rising
up at the toll of that bell to follow the honored hearse; dead
parents waiting above, and calling 'come son,' lost children,
heaven's foundlings, hovering around like cherubim, and whispering
'welcome, father.'"</p>

<p>"Here lies one who reposes after a long feast, where much
love has been; here slumbers, in patience and peace, a veteran,
with all his wounds in front, and not a blot on his scutcheon
after fourscore years of duty well done in the fierce and ceaseless
campaign of life."</p>

<p>This sketch is the best part of Mr. Haywood's address to
the bench and bar of Wake county, delivered shortly after
Mr. Moore's death. If he presents the character of his subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
correctly, as far as he goes, he does not make a complete
sketch.</p>

<p>Mr. Haywood had the reputation of having more learning
than judgment, and his reading in law was very wide;
he was not the man to go into details and marshal the facts
requisite for a perfect sketch.</p>

<p>Mr. Moore feared lest his fellow-countrymen should misjudge
the motives which made him a Union man during the
war. He therefore inserted in his will an <em>item</em> which explains
his views. No great man is ever careless of what his
people and their posterity may think of his conduct. The
records of his adopted county will safely keep his eloquent
words, and the originality of <em>his</em> method of preserving them
will cause them to be republished from time to time.</p>

<p>Item 39 of Mr. Moore's will reads as follows:</p>

<p>"Prior to the late civil war I had been for more than
thirty years much devoted to investigating the nature and
principles of our Federal and State governments, and during
that period, having been several times profoundly exercised
as to the true and lawful powers of each&mdash;not as a politician,
but as a citizen truly devoted to my country&mdash;I was unable,
under my conviction of the solomn duties of patriotism, to
give any excuse for or countenance to the Civil War of 1861
without sacrificing all self-respect. My judgment was the instructor
of my conscience, and no man suffered greater misery
than did I as the scenes of battle unfolded the bloody carnage
of war in the midst of our homes. I had been taught under
the deep conviction of my judgment that there could be no
reliable liberty of my State without the union of the States,
and being devoted to my State, I felt that I should desert her
whenever I should aid to destroy the Union. I could not
imagine a more terrible spectacle than that of beholding the
sun shining upon the broken and dishonored fragments of
States dissolved, discordant and belligerent, and on a land rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
with civil feuds and drenched in fraternal blood. With this
horrible picture of anarchy and blood looming up before my
eyes, I could not, as a patriot, consent to welcome its approach
to my own native land, and truly was I happy when I saw the
sun of peace rising with the glorious promise to shine once
more on States equal and free, honored and united. And
although the promise has been long delayed by an unwise
policy, and I myself may never see the full-orbed sun of liberty
shine on my country and every part of it as once it did,
yet I have strong hopes that my countrymen will yet be
blessed with that glorious light."</p>

<p>The argument of Mr. Moore, or <em>brief</em>, as it is called, in the
<i>State</i> vs. <i>Will</i>, is the best thing of the kind in the law books
of this State. I cannot prophesy much of a future in any
field of public service for that young man who shall fail to
be impressed and interested by this powerful production. I
therefore give it entire.</p>

<h3><a name="ARGUMENT_IN_THE_STATE_vs_WILL" id="ARGUMENT_IN_THE_STATE_vs_WILL">ARGUMENT IN THE STATE <i>vs.</i> WILL.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY B. F. MOORE.</p>


<p>The defendant was indicted for the murder of one Richard
Baxter, and on the trial before Judge Donnell, at Edgecombe,
on the last Circuit, the jury returned the following
special verdict, viz.:</p>

<p>"That the prisoner, Will, was the property of James S.
Battle, and the deceased, Richard Baxter, was the overseer
of said Battle, and entrusted with the management of the
prisoner at the time of the commission of the homicide; that
early in the morning of the 22d day of January last, on
which day the killing took place, the prisoner had a dispute
with slave Allen, who was likewise the property of said
Battle, and a foreman on the same plantation of which the deceased
was overseer; that the dispute between the prisoner
and the said Allen arose about a hoe which the former claimed
to use exclusively on the farm on account of his having helved
it in his own time; but which the latter directed another slave
to use on that day. That some angry words passed between
the prisoner and the foreman, upon which the prisoner broke
out the helve, and went off about one-fourth of a mile to his
work, which was packing cotton with a screw; that very soon
after the dispute between the prisoner and the foreman, the
latter informed the deceased what had occurred, who immediately
went into his house; that while the deceased was in
his house, his wife was heard to say, 'I would not, my dear,'
to which he replied in a positive tone of voice, 'I will'; that
in a very short time after this the deceased came out of his
house to the place where the foreman was, and told him that
he, the deceased, was going after the prisoner, and directed
the foreman to take his cowhide and follow him at a distance;
that the deceased then returned into the house and took his
gun, mounted his horse and rode to the screw, a distance of
about six hundred yards, where the prisoner was at work;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
that the deceased came up within twenty or twenty-five feet
of the screw without being observed by the prisoner; dismounted
and hastily got over the fence into the screw-yard;
that the deceased, with his gun in his hand, walked directly
to the box on which the prisoner was standing, engaged in
throwing cotton, and ordered the prisoner to come down; that
the prisoner took off his hat in an humble manner and came
down; that the deceased spoke some words to the prisoner
which were not heard by any of the three negroes present;
that the prisoner thereupon made off, and getting between
ten and fifteen steps from the deceased, the deceased fired
upon him; that the report of the gun was very loud, and the
whole load lodged in the prisoner's back, covering a space of
twelve inches square; that the wound caused thereby might
have produced death; that the prisoner continued to make off
through a field, and after retreating in a run about one hundred
and fifty yards in sight of the deceased, the deceased
directed two of the slaves present to pursue him through the
field, saying that 'he could not go far'; that the deceased
himself, laying down his gun, mounted his horse, and having
directed his foreman, who had just come up to pursue the
prisoner likewise, rode round the field and headed the prisoner;
that as soon as the deceased had done this, he dismounted,
got over the fence and pursued the prisoner on foot;
that as soon as the prisoner discovered he was headed, he
changed his course to avoid the deceased, and ran in another
direction towards the wood; that after pursuing the prisoner
on foot two or three hundred yards, the deceased came up
with him and collared him with his right hand; that at this
moment the negroes ordered to pursue the prisoner were running
towards the prisoner and the deceased; that the prisoner
had run before he was overtaken by the deceased five or
six hundred yards from the place where he was shot; that it
was not more than six or eight minutes from the time of the
shooting till the slaves in pursuit came to where the prisoner
and deceased were engaged; that in a short time the said
slaves came up, and being ordered by the deceased, one of them
attempted to lay hold of the prisoner, who had his knife
drawn, and the left thumb of the deceased in his mouth; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the prisoner struck at said slave with his knife, missed him
and cut the deceased in the thigh. That in the scuffle between
the prisoner and the deceased, after the deceased overtook
the prisoner, the deceased received from the prisoner a
wound in his arm which occasioned his death; and that the
deceased had no weapons during the scuffle. That soon after,
the deceased let go his hold on the prisoner, who ran towards
the nearest woods and escaped; that the deceased did not pursue
him, but directed the slaves to do so; that the deceased
soon recalled the slaves, and when they returned the deceased
was sitting on the ground bleeding, and as they came up the
deceased said, 'Will has killed me; if I had minded what my
poor wife said, I should not have been in this fix.' That besides
the wound on his thigh the deceased had a slight puncture
on his breast, about skin-deep, and a wound about four
inches long and two inches deep on his right arm, above his
elbow, which was inflicted by the prisoner, and which from
loss of blood occasioned his death, and that he died on the
same day in the evening; that the prisoner went the same
day to his master and surrendered himself; that the next day,
upon being arrested and informed of the death of the deceased,
the prisoner exclaimed, 'Is it possible?' and appeared
so much affected that he came near falling, and was obliged
to be supported. That the homicide and all the circumstances
connected therewith took place in Edgecombe county.</p>

<p>"But whether upon the whole matter aforesaid the said
Will be guilty of the felony and murder in the said indictment
specified and charged upon him, the said jurors are altogether
ignorant, and pray the advice of the Court thereupon.
And if upon the whole matter aforesaid it shall appear
to the Court that he is guilty of the felony and murder wherewith
he stands charged, then, they find him guilty. If upon
the whole matter aforesaid, it shall appear to the Court that
he is not guilty of the murder aforesaid charged upon him
by said indictment, then the said jurors upon their oaths aforesaid,
do say, that the said Will is not guilty of the murder
aforesaid, as the said Will has for himself above in pleading
alleged, but that the said Will is only guilty of feloniously
killing and slaying the said Richard Baxter." Upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
special verdict, his Honor gave judgment that the prisoner
was guilty of murder, and pronounced sentence of death;
whereupon the prisoner appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B. F. Moore for the prisoner.</span>&mdash;It is conceded that Baxter
occupied the place of master, and, in his capacity of overseer,
was invested with all the authority of owner, in the means of
rendering the prisoner subservient to his lawful commands.
With this concession, freely made, it is believed, that if the
shot of the deceased had proved fatal, he had been guilty of
murder, and not of manslaughter only. The instrument used,
and the short distance between the parties, were calculated to
produce death; and nothing but the want of malice could have
deprived the act of any of the features of murder. The disobedience
of running from his master on account of threatened
chastisement, however provoking, does not justify the
death of a slave. It is truly calculated to surprise the master
into a sudden gust of passion, and, on this account, death inflicted
during such a moment may well be mitigated to the
offense of manslaughter. But it is only the surprise of the
passions that will extenuate their transport. Divest the act
of all idea of surprise, it then becomes deliberate, and in law,
there will be no difference between shooting for the disobedience
at the moment of running away, and many days thereafter.
It is clear then, that if Baxter's shot had been fatal,
he had been guilty of murder and not of manslaughter. For,
that he loaded his gun and proceeded to the cotton-screw with
the intent to shoot the prisoner, if the latter should make off,
is manifest from his whole conduct, and particularly so, from
the fact of his directing the foreman to walk behind at a distance.
If he had armed himself for defense, expecting a conflict
with the prisoner, he would have summoned his aid and
kept it at his heels ready for the encounter. The bloody purpose
of shooting had certainly been formed, and the time
given him for reflection and the calm concoction of his plans
evince a settled design and perfect deliberation. He was not
surprised into the act of shooting; it was deliberate; it was
expected and intended beforehand, and, therefore, murderous.</p>

<p>It is further believed by the prisoner's counsel, that if on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
firing the shot, Baxter had rushed towards him in a threatening
manner, and the prisoner had turned, being unable to
escape, and slain the deceased, the act had been homicide
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se defendendo</i>, and this upon the clearest principles of criminal
law.</p>

<p>The prisoner's counsel contends:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That if Baxter's shot had killed the prisoner, Baxter
would have been guilty of manslaughter at the least.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, This position being established, the killing of Baxter
under the circumstances stated is but manslaughter in the
prisoner.</p>

<p>The first position would seem too plain to be argued; but as
an opinion appears to be rapidly pervading the public mind
that any means may be resorted to to coerce the perfect submission
of the slave to his master's will, and that any resistance
to that will, reasonable or unreasonable, lawfully places
the life of the slave at his master's feet, it may be useful to
attempt to draw the line, if there be any, between the lawful
and unlawful exercise of the master's power. That there is
such a line, though it may be difficult in all cases to find it
and fix it with precision, is nevertheless true; and although the
courts may resolve that in all cases short of homicide they will
not look for it, yet, disagreeable and perplexing as the task
may be, they cannot avoid the search so long as a master may
be tried for the homicide of the slave, or so long as the slave
may set up any defense for the homicide of his master.</p>

<p>It is not intended to combat the correctness of the decision
in the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Mann</i>, 2 Dev., 263, though that case leaves the
slave, when his life is spared, under the slender guardianship
of the "frowns and execrations" of a moral community
against cruelty. That decision is not understood by me as
some have expounded it. In declaring that a master cannot
be indicted for a battery on his slave, the Court is not to be
understood to affirm that he cannot be indicted for any offense
which necessarily includes a battery. I apprehend the substance
of their decision to be that they will take no cognizance
of any violence done to the slave by the master which does
not produce death. It is true, there is a portion of the opinion
of the Court which puts the slave entirely out of the pale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the law, and secures the master in a despotic immunity. On
page 266 the Court says: "Such obedience is the consequence
of only uncontrolled authority over the body; there is nothing
else which can operate to produce the effect; the power of the
master must be absolute to render the submission of the slave
perfect. In the actual condition of things it must be so,
there is no remedy; this discipline belongs to the state of
slavery; they cannot be disunited without abrogating at once
the right of the master and absolving the slave from his obligation."
These expressions, it must be admitted, are clear beyond
cavil in their meaning, and that they were selected to
convey, with great accuracy, the opinions of the learned judge
who used them, may be well argued from the frank confession
which he avows of their abhorrence. In truth, they do outlaw
the slave and legalize his destruction at the will of his
master. It is believed, however, that they were never intended
to cover the entire relation between master and slave.
If they were, it is humbly submitted that they are not only
startling and abhorrent to humanity, but at variance with
statute law and decided cases. Uncontrolled authority over
the body is uncontrolled authority over the life; and authority,
to be uncontrolled, can be subject to no question. Absolute
power is irresponsible power, circumscribed by no limits save
its own imbecility, and selecting its own means with an unfettered
discretion. Absolute power is exempt from legal
inquiry, and is absolved from all accountability for the extent
or mode of its exercise.</p>

<p>During its operations it acknowledges no equal which may
check its will, and knows no superior afterwards which may
rightfully punish its deeds. The language of the Court does
not strictly and precisely describe the relation of master and
slave which subsisted in ancient Rome, and does now subsist
in modern Turkey; a relation which this Court in the case of
<i>State</i> vs. <i>Read</i> did most emphatically denounce as inhuman,
unsuited to the genius of our laws, and unnecessary to protect
the master in his legal rights. In that case Judge Henderson
fixes the true boundary of the master's power. It extends,
says he, to securing the services and labors of the slave, and no
farther. And he expressly declares that a power over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
life of the slave is not surrendered by the law, because the
possession of such a power is noways necessary to the purposes
of slavery, and that his life is in the care of the law.</p>

<p>The idea of the perfect submission of the slave is in true
accordance with the policy which should regulate that condition
of life, wherever it may exist. But whether it will more
certainly result from the absolute power of the owner than
from a large but limited authority, is questionable indeed.
More especially, if it be true, as argued in the opinion already
referred to, that the absolute power of the master, although
left unrestrained by law, is checked and fettered by what is
stronger than law, the irresistible force of public sentiment.
If that force is now setting in a counter-current against the
license of absolute power, either it is to be deprecated and
stopped, or absolute power is most clearly proved to be unnecessary
to the ends of slavery. The courts of the country
should foster the enlightened benevolence of the age, and
interpret the powers which one class of the people claim over
another, in conformity, not with the spirit which tolerates
the barbarian who is guilty of savage cruelty, but with that
which heaps upon him the frowns and deep execrations of the
community. All domestic police power must be regulated by
the feelings and views of those who dispense it. If it be true,
then, that public sentiment will no longer tolerate the excessive
cruelties from the master, as is said by Taylor, Chief Justice,
in the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Hale</i>; by Henderson, Chief Justice, in
the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Read</i>; and by Ruffin, Chief Justice, in the <i>State</i>
vs. <i>Mann</i>; and if it be true, likewise, that the relation between
master and slave is to be discovered from the opinions and
feelings of the masters, we cannot hear without surprise that
it is necessary, in the actual condition of things, to clothe the
master with an uncontrolled and absolute authority over the
body of the slave. If such necessity now exists, the rhetorician
hath spoken, and not the judge. If such necessity does
not exist, the power is given for abuse, and not to accomplish
the objects of slavery. It would seem really, that whilst the
courts are lauding the Christian benevolence of the times
manifested by the humane treatment of the slaves, they are
engaged in investigating to what possible extent the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
may push his authority without incurring responsibility.
They feel shocked at the discovery they make themselves,
but rise from their labor with the consolation that few are so
abandoned to a sense of public indignation as to enjoy the
revealed prerogative. If the expression could be divested of
the appearance of sarcasm, some truth might, perhaps, be
found in the assertion that the great result of their disclosure
has been to teach the kind master how merciful and moderate
he is in the midst of such plenitude of power, and the cruel
one, how despised and desecrated he will be if he use its legal
license. Good men will feel no pleasure in the revealment,
bad men will be freed from the check of ignorance.</p>

<p>It is further said in the <i>State</i> vs. <i>Mann</i>, "That the slave,
to remain a slave, must be made sensible that there is no
appeal from his master; that his power in no one instance is
usurped." The language here is equally explicit, and altogether
as strong, as that before quoted. It denies to the slave
the smallest attribute of a rational or feeling creature. It not
only represses thought, and extinguishes all power to deliberate
on any command of his master, however repugnant to
natural justice it may be, and whether its execution is to affect
himself or others; but it professes to control into perfect tameness
the instinct of self-preservation. It would be difficult,
and if it were easy, it would be lamentable, to accomplish the
former; but it would be impossible to effect the latter. Such
insensibility to life would defeat the very object of its inculcation&mdash;the
value of the slave. For we can never hope
to regulate this powerful instinct of nature with an adjustment
which will quietly yield all its love of life into the
hands of a ferocious master and yet preserve it against the
world beside. But if it were desirable so far to annihilate it,
the task is beyond the reach of human ingenuity and not to
be accomplished by the possession of absolute power, however
fearfully enforced or terribly exercised. The relation of
master and slave may repress all the noble energies and manly
sentiments of the soul, and may degrade the moral being into
a brute condition. And when this is done we shall not be
astonished to see the moral brute exhibiting the instinct natural
to the brute condition. How vain must it always be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
when we shall have reduced humanity to its ultimate capability
of degradation, to expect any embellishment of mind to
adorn the wretched existence. If the relation require that the
slave be disrobed of the essential features which distinguish
him from the brute, the relation must adapt itself to the consequences
and leave its subject the instinctive privileges of a
brute.</p>

<p>I am arguing no question of abstract right, but am endeavoring
to prove that the natural incidents of slavery must be
borne with, because they are inherent to the condition itself;
and that any attempt to restrain or punish a slave for the exercise
of a right, which even absolute power cannot destroy, is
inhuman, and without the slightest benefit to the security of
the master, or to that of society at large. The doctrine may
be advanced from the bench, enacted by the Legislature, and
enforced with all the varied agony of torture, and still the
slave cannot believe, and will not believe, "That there is no
one instance" in which the master's power is usurped. Nature,
stronger than all, will discover many instances and vindicate
her rights at any and at every price. When such a stimulant
as this urges the forbidden deed punishment will be powerless
to reclaim or to warn by example. It can serve no purpose
but to gratify the revengeful feelings of one class of people
and to inflame the hidden animosities of the other.</p>

<p>With great deference to the opinion already commented on,
it would appear to me that a conclusion directly the reverse
as to the necessity of the absolute power in the master should
have been drawn from the premises. The slave can only expect
to learn the law of the land as respects the power of the
owner over him, from the manner in which it is generally, and
almost universally, administered by the owner. If their treatment
is now so mild or becoming so, as rarely to require the
interposition of any tribunal for their protection, they will
soon be taught by the conduct of their masters, if not already
taught, that absolute power is not the master's right; and the
consequence which may be expected will be that the slave will
be prepared to resist its exercise when bad men attempt to
commit the cruelties allowed by it. So important is it that
the Court should, as far as possible, conform their exposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
of the rights of men with those sentiments of the public
which, by the Court themselves, are admitted to be wholesome
and just. And especially should they do so when those
rights are constituted by public opinion and almost exclusively
by that alone.</p>

<p>Whatever be the power, however, which the master may
possess, it is given with the sole view to enable him to coerce
the services of the slave, and all experience teaches us that a
power over life is not necessary to effectuate that end.</p>

<p>The usual modes of correction are found to be altogether
sufficient. Punishment short of death serves the end of the
master both as a corrective and as an example. Power over
the life of the slave, being therefore unnecessary, ought not
to be conceded. The use of highly dangerous weapons in
cases of simple disobedience is not tolerated by the law, because
they are calculated to produce death.</p>

<p>If the deceased had been resisted a great degree of force
might have been used, and the law would not have been
scrupulous in determining the excess. If he had been chastising
the prisoner in the ordinary mode and death had ensued,
it would have been nothing more than an unfortunate
accident. But the prisoner was neither resisting his master
nor did the calamity grow out of any attempt to chastise. It
is confidently contended that a master has not by the law of
the land the right to kill his slave for a simple act of disobedience,
however provoking may be the circumstances under
which it is committed; that if a slave be required to stand,
and he run off, he has not forfeited his life. This is conclusive,
if the law will never justify a homicide except it be
committed upon unavoidable necessity, and will never excuse
one, except it be done by misadventure or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se defendendo</i>.
There is no principle of criminal law which will justify or
excuse the death that has been caused through the provocation
of the passions alone.</p>

<p>This court has repudiated all idea of similarity between the
relation of master and apprentice, as understood in the English
law, and that of master and slave as understood in ours.
I cannot perceive the propriety of such total repudiation.
The foundation of both relations is the same, to wit, service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and although the slave may stand in a lower grade than the
mere apprentice, and be more dependent on his master, yet it
is submitted that the difference is in the degree and not in the
nature of the authority which the master of the one or the
other may exercise. This seems to have been the idea of Justice
Blackstone, who, in speaking of homicide by parents and
masters caused by immoderate correction, proceeds: "Thus
by an edict of the Emperor Constantine, when the rigor of
the Roman law began to relax and soften, a master was
allowed to chastise his slave with rods and imprisonment; and
if death accidentally ensued he was guilty of no crime; but
otherwise, if he struck him with a club or a stone, and thereby
occasioned his death, or if in any yet grosser manner (as by
shooting), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">immoderate suo jure utatur, tunc reus homicidii
sit. 4 Bl. Com., 183.</i>"</p>

<p>It is not my purpose, however, to place the slave and apprentice
on the same footing. It is freely conceded that there
is a great difference between the two conditions, and that
many cases of homicide committed precisely under the same
circumstances would be murder of an apprentice, and only
manslaughter of a slave. Thus the master has the right to
beat his apprentice as well as his slave, but the principle is
universal (with a solitary exception), that a man having the
right, under a given provocation, to lay hand upon another,
but using a weapon calculated to produce death, and death
ensuing, is guilty of murder. The exception alluded to is the
slaying of an adulterer caught in the act. Now, if an apprentice
disobeys and runs from his master in order to escape
chastisement, and the master shoots and kills him, it is
murder.</p>

<p>Surely the slaying of the slave under the same circumstances,
after full allowance for the difference in their grade
of life, can be nothing less than manslaughter. If the law,
for the purposes of policy, will not permit the master to be
called to account for batteries, however cruel or unjust, done
on the body of his slave, as it does in the case of an apprentice,
yet when it is obliged to examine the extent of the master's
powers by reason of death, then it will apply the same
reasonable rules in investigating the master's guilt and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
slave's conduct and rights, which it applies in the case of slaying
an apprentice, suiting the rule to the difference of condition.
<cite>1 Hawks</cite>, 217. If, indeed, the master may not be
called to account till the death of his slave, if he have this
wide scope of authority, to be exercised upon his own discretion,
it is highly reasonable that, when he is called to account,
the examination should be rigorous, for it is the only protection
which the slave can claim at the hands of the law, and,
therefore, ought to be strict, in order that it may be the more
efficient. It is here alone that the slave, in the eye of the law,
ascends from the level of mere property, and takes an humble
stand amid his species.</p>

<p>Here he is regarded as a rational creature. <i>Scott's case</i>,
<i>1 Hawks</i>, 24; <i>State</i> vs. <i>Read</i>, <i>2 Hawks</i>, 454. The necessity
of averring that he is property, and whose property, as is
requisite in indictments for the batteries of slaves, is here
dispensed with; and from this distinction alone it would appear
that the courts, in the very form of the indictment for
murder, have not recognized the exemption of the master
from the accountability, common to the world beside, for the
death of a slave. <i>2 Dev.</i>, 264.</p>

<p>The prisoner was shot in the act of making off from his
overseer who was prepared to chastise him. A master's authority
to apprehend his slave cannot be greater than that of a
constable or sheriff to arrest for a misdemeanor; and a constable
may not kill in order to prevent the escape of one guilty
of that grade of offense. The law has so high a regard for
human life that it directs the officer to permit an escape rather
than kill. If the officer act illegally, by abusing his authority,
or exceeding it, resistance unto death is not murder.
But if the master have greater authority to apprehend his
slave than a law-officer hath to arrest, under a precept, for a
misdemeanor, he certainly has not a greater than a sheriff,
acting under a precept, hath to arrest a felon. Here the law
again shows its tender and noble regard for human life and
its detestation of the shedding of human blood. The officer is
not allowed to kill a felon, a murderer, or a traitor, unless his
escape be inevitable. "And in every instance in which one
man can be justified in killing another, the abuse of his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
makes him guilty of manslaughter." <i>Bevil</i>, 78. An officer,
therefore, having the right to kill a felon in order to prevent
his escape, and then doing so when the escape may be prevented
by more lenient means, is guilty of manslaughter.
This necessity must always be proven. It is never to be presumed.
No such necessity appears in the finding of the jury.
In legal contemplation, therefore, it does not exist.</p>

<p>The law enjoins it as a duty on the officer to kill a felon,
rather than permit his escape, upon the presumption, I suppose,
that if he do escape, he will forever elude the penalty of
his crime. Such is not the case with a runaway slave, who,
in general, may be certainly recaptured. No one will be
found to maintain that it is the duty of the master to kill his
slave rather than suffer his temporary escape. The prisoner
was in the act of disobedience and not of resistance, between
which there is a substantial difference. Act of 1791, <i>Bevil</i>,
114. The deceased then greatly exceeded his authority;
whether the prisoner is to be considered in the light of an apprentice,
of one who had committed an aggravated misdemeanor,
or even in that of a felon; and if death had ensued,
I conclude that he would have been guilty of manslaughter
at the least.</p>

<p>This brings us to the important question in this case. Was
the prisoner justly so provoked by the shooting as, under the
influence of ordinary human frailty, to cause his reason to be
dethroned, and to be deprived of deliberation? Or, in the
language of Judge Haywood, in Norris's case, "was not the
prisoner thereby deprived of the free and proper exercise of
his rational faculties, owing to the fury of resentment, not
unreasonably conceived?" If he was, that ends the question.
Was it such a provocation as, allowing for the disparity of the
free and slave condition of men in this country, was well calculated,
even in minds tolerably well regulated, to throw a man
off his guard and excite a furious anger? If so, the <i>State</i> vs.
<i>Merrill</i>, <i>2 Dev.</i>, 279 (Ruffin's opinion), determines the fate
of the prisoner. An appeal to human nature in its most degraded
state will answer, unhesitatingly, it was. No man can
reason and respond otherwise. And it appears to me that an
appeal to the principles of law, as founded in the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
man and recognized for centuries, will leave not a particle
of doubt. Can the prisoner be guilty of murder? Who can
review the circumstances of the case, and in candor pronounce
that they carry in them "the plain indication of a heart
regardless of social duty, and fatally bent on mischief?" If
this case can be made to reach this standard definition of murder,
what bosom is there which does not luxuriate in the poison
of murderous thought? And in vain may nature plead her
wrongs and the tempest of the passions to excuse the indiscretion
of her fitful moments. It may be murder, but if so, it
must find its guilt, not in the human disposition, but in a
policy that knows no frailty and shows no mercy. That
policy is yet to be declared; I will not suppose its intended
application to this case, and I shall, therefore, for the present,
take the liberty of discussing the defense upon the received
principles which define murder and distinguish it from manslaughter.</p>

<p>Murder is the felonious killing of a human creature with
deliberation. The act must have three intents. 1. An intent
to kill or hurt. 2. An intent to kill or hurt unjustly. 3. The
intent must be deliberate. It is only necessary in this case
to consider the deliberation of the intent; for it is admitted
that the intent of the prisoner was to kill or hurt, and that it
was unjust; but it is denied that it was deliberate.</p>

<p>The intent is not deliberate if there be provoking cause.</p>

<p>The mischievous, vindictive disposition essential to constitute
the crime of murder is implied from the want of legal
cause of provocation. The greatest care should be taken not
to confound a vindictive act with such an act as shows a vindictive
disposition. Every case of manslaughter, perpetrated
in anger, is a vindictive act, whilst every case of murder exhibits
the vindictive disposition. A vindictive act simply is
the result of ordinary frailty; a vindictive disposition is the
attendant of extraordinary depravity. The former comes of
a surprise of the passions; the latter marshals, stimulates, and
leads the passions.</p>

<p>Manslaughter wants one of the above intents which define
murder. It implies an intent to kill or hurt, and that the
intent is unjust, but supposes the absence of deliberation, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the presence of a justly provoking cause. But what is justly
provoking cause? In our search for the meaning of the expression
we cannot consult the vague notions of men as to
insults. There would not only be no certainty in them as a
guide, but they would strip men of all security for their lives.
We must appeal to the common law as it has recognized excusable
frailties. Its principles, being bottomed on human
nature civilized by legal restraints and legal privileges, adapt
themselves with a happy facility to all the changes and modifications
of society, and to all the mutations in the relations
of its parts. These principles, having discarded the idea of
legal provocation from words, have resolved the foundation of
their existence into the protection of the person.</p>

<p>Self-preservation, being a prime law of nature, and indispensable
to the first and permanent interests of society, the
instinct is fostered instead of being checked. The policy of
the law to cherish it is what dispenses indulgence to an excess
of force requisite to preserve it and palliates an unnecessary
homicide. If human institutions could so blunt this sense as
to effectuate a law which should forbid blow for blow not
threatening death, the introduction of slavery, to a great
degree, would be already prepared. If, however, the degradation
should stop at this point, still there would be a very
ample scope for this powerful sense to act in, and a dangerous
attack, or a blow menacing death, being out of the customary
sufferance, would call up, in vigor, the unsubdued though
mutilated sense, and surprise it into action. It is not the
object of the law, in its regulation of the relation of master
and slave, to destroy any portion of the instinct of self-preservation.
On the contrary, it would be rejoiced to preserve it
entire, but this is inconsistent with the subjection of the slave,
without which he is valueless. If this instinct were permitted
to be displayed by the slave as by a freeman, the authority of
the master would be at an end. Hence it is that when it is
not so essential to be curbed it is allowed to enjoy a wider
range; as, in respect of strangers who have no right to assume
any authority, it is permitted to turn many degrees toward
the condition of freemen. Hence it is, too, that whenever
the law, for the purpose of sustaining the relation of the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
parts of society deemed essential to the peace and safety
of the whole, tolerates its partial suppression, it provides the
best possible security against any abuse likely to occur because
of its required extinction. Thus it gives to the wife
the protection of love and identity of welfare; to the child
the shield of affection; to the apprentice the guaranty of a
penal bond; and to the slave the guard of interest. In general,
in proportion as these securities are weaker, that of the
law itself ought to be stronger; and, in proportion as the subjection
in the one or the other of these relations is required to
be greater or less, so must the suppression of this instinct be
greater or less. The subjection in the relation of slavery
ought to be greater, and so ought the extinction of the instinct
to be greater than in any of the other relations. It is the
legal duty of all who are subjects in any one of them to adapt
and conform this instinct to the extent necessary to maintain
the relation; and if any one do not, he shall not plead its want
of subjection in excuse of a deed occasioned by his neglect of
duty. If an apprentice, being under lawful correction, shall
resist and slay his master, it is murder, and not manslaughter,
because the law cannot admit that he was provoked. If a
slave be under any correction, with or without cause from his
master, provided it do not threaten death or great bodily harm,
and he resist and kill his master, this is murder likewise, and for
the same reason, as the law requires this degree of submission
from him. But if the apprentice be unlawfully beaten and he
resist and kill his master, it is not murder, because the law
hath not required him to extinguish his instinct of preservation
to such an extent, and therefore it admits that he was
provoked; so, if a slave be beset by his master in a manner
to threaten death and he slay his master, this cannot be murder,
because the law hath not required him to extinguish his
instinct to so great a degree, and, therefore, it admits that he
was provoked. In a word, in those bounds within which the
law has enjoined it as a duty to curb the instinct of self-preservation,
we are not allowed to display it, and if we do,
the law cannot hear the defense of provocation; but all display
of it, out of these bounds, is admissible and is the effect of
legal provocation. The law demands it as a duty that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
should tame our passions to suit the conditions which it has
assigned us. It supposes that this duty will become habitual
and consequently easy of performance, and that we will conform
ourselves to its requirements. This, and this alone, is
the true foundation of all the distinction between the master
and the apprentice, between the freeman and the slave.</p>

<p>But having conformed ourselves to a given and required
degradation, to an enjoined submission, we are ready by our
very nature and habits to resist any degradation or submission
greatly beyond that which we have learned to acquiesce
in as a duty. When a slave is required to bare his back to
the rod, he does it because it is usual; but when he is required
to stand as a target for his master's gun, he is startled&mdash;no
idea of duty sustains the requirement and the unquelled portion
of his instinct rouses his passions to resistance.</p>

<p>Human institutions are inadequate to the task of settling a
condition in society which shall impart to its members the
highest perfection of philosophic fortitude and the lowest
degradation of animal existence&mdash;which shall blend into harmony
the reasonable man and the passionless brute.</p>

<p>When it is declared that a slave is a reasonable or human
creature, and that he is the subject of felony at common law;
that murder and manslaughter both may be perpetrated on his
person, that himself may commit both, it would seem to
result that he was acknowledged to possess the infirmities
common to his species. That they must be palliated in some
cases, even when the master is the victim, I hope I have satisfactorily
shown. And now I come to the deliberate conclusion
that the only difference caused by the relation consists
in the fact that there are some acts of the slave which constitute
provocation that would not if done by a freeman;
some which would constitute provocation to the master which
would not to a stranger; and on the contrary, that a slave is
not permitted to be provoked at many acts done by a stranger
freeman which would constitute a lawful provocation if done
by a fellow-slave; and that a great variety of acts done by the
master shall not be sufficient cause of provocation which, if
done by a stranger, would be so deemed, but that in not a single
relation in which the slave is placed by law is he debarred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
every case of violence to his person from feeling and pleading
a legal provocation.</p>

<p>If I have been successful in showing that the deceased
greatly abused his authority by shooting at the prisoner, and
that the act was calculated to produce a resentment not unreasonably
conceived, the inference in law is irresistible that if
the prisoner, immediately on being shot, had turned and slain
the deceased, it could not have been more than manslaughter;
and the only important point now remaining to be
discussed is whether the interval of time between the reception
of the injury and the commission of the homicide enhances
the guilt of the deed. The law would be vain and nugatory
as a rule of action if it should allow that the passions may be
justly provoked and yet refuse to allow a reasonable time for
their subsidence. When it says that reason may be dethroned
it is never guilty of the solecism of holding the judgment
accountable till reason can be reseated. Whether there
may have been sufficient time for that important operation of
the faculties, is a question often dependent on the circumstances
of the case. The continuance of the original exciting
causes and the addition of subsequent stimulants being necessarily
calculated to prevent the restoration of reason, may
prolong the time till they cease to exist; nor even then, at the
very moment of their cessation, does the law demand that
the bosom shall return to its calm and tranquillity. Such an
instantaneous repose is no more to be looked for, in the tempest
of the passions, than it is in the storms of the ocean,
whose angry waves are often seen to run mountain high long
after the dark cloud hath passed away, and the raving wind
hath fled from the conflict, leaving its enraged victim heaving
with agitation beneath a tranquil and sunny heaven.</p>

<p>The time in this case was but six or eight minutes, and the
wound calculated to produce death. If the exciting cause of
provocation had here ceased, it would be a rigid and unnatural
rule, to require, at the expiration of this short period, the
presence of a responsible judgment; for it is perfectly apparent,
that in proportion to the severity of the injury
received, will be the length of time which nature demands
to adjust the shaken balance of the mind. The prisoner had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
much cause to suspect that his wound would prove fatal; and
no man, either bond or free, laboring under the excitement
incident to such a situation, could, so soon, have quelled his
fury and recalled his scattered senses. But these few moments
were not allowed to be moments of rest and thought to
the wounded man. They were moments of flight and active
pursuit; flight, by a man, dangerously shot, his wounds bleeding
in profusion, and chafed into agony by the friction of his
clothes and the motions of his body; pursuit by a man who
had meditated and attempted a deadly injury; who called to
his aid three more men, ready to execute his purposes, whatever
they might be, and who was well aware of the mangled
condition of his victim, and who, under the full conviction of
his shot proving fatal, cheered his comrades of the chase, by
the unfeeling exclamation, "He can't run far." Let it be remembered,
too, that the prisoner, during this space of time, had
run a distance of five or six hundred yards; that he was overtaken
by a man who, in moments perfectly cool, when compared
with those in which he captured the prisoner, had not
hesitated to shoot him at a distance of a few rods, and by what
logic can we arrive at the conclusion, either that the prisoner
had enjoyed opportunity to regain his judgment, or that he
had not every reason to apprehend from the deceased the finishing
stroke to his life? How could he be trusted, with every
passion inflamed to madness, who in cooler times had violated
every duty as a man, had deliberately prepared himself to
take the life of his fellow-man, and, as a superintendent, had,
for trifling cause, attempted to destroy valuable property entrusted
to his care? In no part of the slave's conduct does he
evince a disposition to seek a conflict. He takes every occasion
to avoid it. When he is headed, he does not hesitate to
turn his course, and flee from an encounter.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion,
that this case is of higher grade than manslaughter, if of that;
and whatever may be the prisoner's fate, I am free to declare,
and with the most sincere candor, that I do not recognize in
his conduct the moral depravity of a murderer, nor any high
degree of inaptitude to the condition of slavery. He was
disobedient, it is true, and ran to avoid chastisement. Three-fourths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of our slaves occasionally do this. He slew his overseer,
it is true, after having been dangerously shot, pursued
and overtaken. The tamest and most domestic brute will do
likewise. And I feel that if he must expiate the deed under
the gallows, he will be a victim, not of his own abandoned
depravity, but a sacrifice offered to the policy which regulates
the relation of slavery among us. But before he is sacrificed,
it may be useful to inquire into that policy. The interests of
society demand that it should be fixed, and permanently fixed,
that the master may know the extent of his authority, and the
slave prepare himself to its accommodation.</p>

<p>No question can be more delicate, or attended with so many
bad consequences if settled in error. It would be next to impossible
for the judiciary to adjust this relation adversely to
any strong and deliberate opinion entertained by the public
mind. The momentum of this feeling, acting through the
juries of the country and the spirit of the Legislature, would
be too powerful, successfully to be encountered by the courts.
And in whatsoever decided current it might run, it would,
finally, bear into its channel all interpretations of the law.</p>

<p>By a timely and judicious administration of the law, however,
in relation to this subject, the courts may effect much in
the formation of public opinion, and at this time they may
exert the opportunities afforded by their situation, in a most
happy manner to impart fixedness and stability to those principles
which form the true basis of the policy. They have of
late frequently announced from the bench the progression of
humanity in this relation, and their clear conviction that the
condition of the slave was rapidly advancing in amelioration,
under the benign influence of Christian precept and the
benevolent auspices of improving civilization. It is believed
that these convictions were founded in truth, and the various
laws on the statute books bring ample testimony to the fact.
As far as slavery has been the subject of legislation for the
last ninety years, it has been undergoing a gradual revolution
in favor of the slave, and it is confidently asserted, not adverse
to the best interests of the master, or of the security of the
public. In a popular government we can nowhere look for
more correct information of the state of the public mind, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
a subject deeply interesting to the people at large, than in their
laws. The history of the legislation of the State for the last
century on this subject, during which more than a dozen principal
acts have been passed at intervals, is a history of a gradual
progression in the improvement of the condition of the
slave, in the protection of his person, his comforts, and
those rights not necessary to be surrendered to his master.
The length of time in which this evidence of a common sentiment
has been continuing in one course, is irrefutable testimony
of its being the true and deliberate sense of the community.
Very lately the whole subject came before the
Legislature; and though it was at a time when the public
mind was inflamed and alarmed at a recent and yet reeking
massacre, they did not relax the laws made for their protection,
nor render their lives or persons less secure. From the
Act of 1741, which put the life of the slave, on trial, in the
hands of three justices and four freeholders, down to that of
1831, which secures, beyond doubt, the right of the slave to a
jury of slave owners, there will be found, without a solitary
retrograde, one continued, persevering, and unbroken series
of laws, raising the slave higher and higher in the scale of
moral being. To the period of 1794, the character of the
acts, though they are not numerous, nor strongly marked
with exclusive benefit to the slave, is evincive of an intent to
afford protection, where before it was weak.</p>

<p>It is not possible that there can be found, anywhere, a plainer
manifestation of a decided intent to raise the consideration
and standing of the slave than is expressed in these acts of
the Legislature. Will the Court disappoint this unequivocal
intention? Will they rebuke the spirit of the age and strike
back this unfortunate race of men, advancing from the depths
of misery and wretchedness to a higher ground under the
shield of so much legislation enacted in their behalf?</p>

<p>Our laws furnish incontestable evidence of what is the enlightened
sentiment of the State. The history of other nations
affords a body of luminous information to instruct us
what that sentiment should be; and I feel no small pleasure
in believing that the legislative policy of our past and present
day most fully accords with that course which the long tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
experience of bygone ages has distinctly marked out as the
wiser and better one.</p>

<p>Upon this subject the Baron Montesquieu has gathered the
choicest materials of every age, clime, and nation. With a
mind, formed in the mould of patience itself; strong by nature
and enriched with a philosophic cultivation, he hath
executed the task of analysis with the most profound and
discriminating sagacity. With no object in view but the
advancement of political knowledge, he hath unmasked all
the forms of government, traced to the fountain the principles
of their action, and exposed to the meanest capacity the deep-hidden
reasons of all the diversified relations of man, and the
true genius of the laws necessary to support them.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Spirit of Laws</cite>, Vol. I, p. 291 <i>et seq.</i>, to 298, he
treats of the subject of slavery, and informs us as the result
of his inquiries that in governments whose policy is warlike,
and the citizens ever ready with arms in their hands to quell
attempts to regain liberty, slaves may be treated with great
rigor and severity without the hazard of servile wars; but that
in republics, where the policy is essentially pacific, and the
citizens devoted to the arts of peace and industry, the treatment
of slaves should be mild and humane; that the power of
the master should not be absolute, and that the slave should
be put within the keeping of the law. If that candid and
ingenious writer be not deceived in his conclusions, he has
given us a hint for the regulation of our domestic servitude,
the neglect of which may lead to the most fatal sequel. Our
government is perhaps the most pacific on earth, and the citizens
most addicted to the pursuits of civilized life. How
inconsistent, then, will it be in us to adopt a policy in relation
to our slaves which must be either yielded up or must change
the habits and character of our people, and ultimately our
form of government, with the blessing of liberty itself.</p>

<p>We may not expect that the danger of servile wars will
only operate to arm the citizens generally in their own defense.
The recent insurrection may show, indeed, the formation of
numerous companies of yeomanry for the purpose of being
always ready to meet and vanquish the earliest movements of
insurrectionary slaves; but a little observation at this time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
so soon, too, after the panic that gave rise to these preparations,
will serve to show that at the present moment there remains
scarcely a single one of the many associations which were then
formed. They grew up with the panic, and they have vanished
with it. It must be apparent, then, if ever ready arms
are necessary to our safety, they must be lodged in hands not
filled with other occupations, but responsible to the public for
efficiency and dispatch. In other words, if a display of force
be requisite to chain down the spirit of insurrection or stop
the bloody career of its actual march, a standing army, which
will leave the great body of citizens to pursue their favorite
occupations of peace in perfect security, will be the loud demand
of the community. How certainly such a permanent
association of armed men, first formed to preserve the relations
of our slavery, will ultimately introduce a civil slavery over
the whole land, the experience of other nations, and the warning
of our own Constitution, will most fearfully answer. I
know it has been frequently said, and with some it is a favorite
idea, that the more cruel the master, the more subservient
will be the slave. This precept is abhorrent to humanity, and
is a heresy unsupported by the great mass of historic experience.
The despair of individuals cannot last forever; neither
will that of a numerous people afflicted with common wrongs,
and exchanging a common sympathy. Rome had no servile
wars till her masters had outraged every feeling of justice and
benevolence and made their slaves drink the cup of unmitigated
cruelty to its last drop; nor had she any, that I remember,
after the first Christian prince of the empire had relaxed
the intolerable degradations of that unfortunate class of her
people.</p>

<p>I feel and acknowledge, as strongly as any man can, the
inexorable necessity of keeping our slaves in a state of dependence
and subservience to their masters. But when shooting
becomes necessary to prevent insolence and disobedience,
it only serves to show the want of proper domestic rules, but
it will never supply it; and never can a punishment like this
effect any other purpose than to produce open conflicts or
secret assassinations.</p>

<p>In adjusting the balance of this delicate subject, let it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
be believed that the great and imminent danger is in overloading
the scale of humanity. The courts must pass through
Scylla and Charybdis; and they may be assured that the peril
of shipwreck is not avoided, by shunning with distant steerage,
the whirlpool of Northern fanaticism. That of the South is
equally fatal. It may not be so visibly seen, but it is as deep,
as wide, and as dangerous.</p>

<small>BY MRS. C. P. SPENCER</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>James Johnston Pettigrew, late a Brigadier-General in the
army of the Confederate States, was born at Lake Scuppernong,
in Tyrrell county, North Carolina, upon the 4th day
of July, 1828. His family is of French extraction. At an
early period, however, one branch of it emigrated to Scotland,
where it may be traced holding lands near Glasgow about the
year 1492. Afterwards a portion of it removed to the northern
part of Ireland. From this place James Pettigrew, the
great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch, about the year
1732, came into Pennsylvania, and, some twenty years afterwards,
into North Carolina. About 1770 this gentleman removed
to South Carolina, leaving here, however, his son
Charles, who was a resident successively of the counties of
Granville, Chowan, and Tyrrell. Charles Pettigrew was subsequently
the first Bishop-elect of the Protestant Episcopal
Church in this Diocese. He died in 1807, and his memory
survives fragrant with piety, charity, and an extended usefulness.
His son, Ebenezer, succeeded to his estates and reputation,
devoting his life to the successful drainage and cultivation
of the fertile lands which he owned and to the government
of the large family of which he was the head. Mr.
Pettigrew resisted every solicitation presented by his neighbors
for the employment of his talents in public service.
Upon one occasion alone was his reluctance overcome. In
1835 he was chosen by a very flattering vote to represent his
district in the Congress of the United States. At that election
he received the rare compliment of an almost unanimous
vote from his fellow-citizens of Tyrrell, failing to obtain but
three votes out of more than seven hundred. He could not
be prevailed upon to be a candidate at a second election. Mr.
Pettigrew married Miss Shepard, a daughter of the distinguished
family of that name seated at New Bern. She died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
in July, 1830, when her son James Johnston was but two
years of age. Ebenezer Pettigrew lived until July, 1848,
having witnessed with great sensibility the very brilliant
opening of his son's career among the contemporary youth
of the land.</p>

<p>After his mother's death the child was taken to the home of
his grandmother at New Bern, and there remained until he
was carried into Orange county to pursue his education. Owing
to an unfortunate exposure whilst an infant, young Pettigrew
became a delicate boy, but by diligent and systematic
exercise he gradually inured his constitution to endure without
harm extraordinary fatigue and the extremes of weather.
He was a member of various schools at Hillsborough from
the year 1836, enjoying the advantages of instruction by Mr.
Bingham for about four years previous to becoming a student
at the University. During this period the state of his
health required him to be often at home for several months
together. He was a member of the University of North
Carolina during a full term of four years, graduating there
at the head of his class in June, 1847. From early childhood
young Pettigrew had been noted as a boy of extraordinary
intellect. At all the schools he was easily first in every class
and in every department of study. He seemed to master his
text-books by intuition. They formed the smallest portion of
his studies, for his eager appetite for learning ranged widely
over subjects collateral to his immediate tasks. Nor did they
always stop here. His father was amused and gratified upon
one occasion to observe the extent to which he had profited
by his excursions among the medical books of an eminent physician
at Hillsborough, of whose family he was an inmate at
the age of fourteen. In the class-room at the University he
appeared in reciting rather to have descended to the level of
the lesson than to have risen up to it. Student as he was, and
somewhat reserved in demeanor, he was nevertheless very
popular with his fellows, and the object of their enthusiastic
admiration.</p>

<p>Anecdotes were abundant as to the marvelous range of his
acquirements, and the generosity and patience with which he
contributed from his stores even to the dullest applicant for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
aid. Nor was it only in letters that he was chief. A fencing-master,
who happened to have a class among the collegians,
bore quite as decided testimony to his merits in fencing
as he had obtained from the various chairs of the faculty
respecting his proficiency in their several branches.</p>

<p>The commencement at which he graduated was distinguished
by the attendance of President Polk, Secretary
Mason and Lieutenant Maury of the National Observatory.
Impressed by the homage universally paid to his talents and
acquirements, as well as by the high character of his graduating
oration, these gentlemen proposed to him to become an
assistant in the Observatory. After spending some weeks in
recreation, Mr. Pettigrew reported to Lieutenant Maury, and
remained with him for six or eight months. In the occupations
of this office he fully maintained his earlier promise, but
soon relinquished the position, inasmuch as the exposure and
labor incident to it were injuriously affecting his health.</p>

<p>After an interval of travel in the Northern States, Mr. Pettigrew,
in the fall of 1848, became a student of law in the
office of James Mason Campbell, Esq., of Baltimore, where he
remained for several months. At the close of this period, by
the solicitation of his kinsman, the late James L. Petigru of
Charleston, S. C., he entered his office with the design of
being subsequently associated with him in the practice of his
profession. Upon obtaining license, Mr. Pettigrew, by the
advice of the kinsman just mentioned, proceeded to Berlin and
to other universities in Germany, in order to perfect himself
in the civil law. He remained in Europe for nearly three
years. Two years of this time he devoted to study, the
remainder he spent in traveling upon the Continent, and in
Great Britain and Ireland. He availed himself of this opportunity
of becoming acquainted with modern European languages
so far as to be able to speak with ease German, French,
Italian, and Spanish. During this tour he contracted a great
partiality for Spanish character and history, having had considerable
opportunity for studying the former, not only as a
private gentleman, but also as Secretary of Legation, for a
short while, to Colonel Barringer, then Minister of the United
States near the Court of Spain. It may be proper to add here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
that among the unaccomplished designs of Mr. Pettigrew, to
which he had given some labor, was that of following Prescott
in further narratives of the connection of Spain with America,
and as a preliminary to this, he had made a collection of works
in Arabic, and had made himself acquainted with that language.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettigrew returned to Charleston in November, 1852,
and entered upon the practice of law in connection with his
honored and accomplished relative. He profited so well by
his studies in Europe and by his subsequent investigations,
that in the opinion of his partner, who was well qualified to
judge, he became a master of the civil law not inferior in
acquisition and in grasp of principle to any in the United
States. His success at the bar was brilliant. In 1856 he
was chosen one of the representatives of the city in the Legislature,
holding his seat under that election for the two sessions
of December, 1856, and December, 1857. He rose to great
distinction in that body. His report against the reopening of
the slave-trade, and his speech upon the organization of the
Supreme Court, gave him reputation beyond the bounds of the
State. He failed to be reelected in 1858.</p>

<p>Mr. Pettigrew persistently refused to receive any portion of
the income of the partnership of which he was a member.
Independent in property, and simple in his habits of personal
expenditure, he displayed no desire to accumulate money.
Noble in every trait of character, he held the contents of his
purse subject to every draft that merit might present.</p>

<p>For some years previous to the rupture between the North
and the South, Mr. Pettigrew had anticipated its occurrence,
and believing it to be his duty to be prepared to give his best
assistance to the South, in such event, had turned his attention
to military studies. Like many other rare geniuses, he had
always a partiality for mathematics, and so very naturally
devoted much time to that branch of this science which deals
with war. Even as far back as 1850 he had been desirous of
becoming an officer in the Prussian army; and negotiations
for that end, set upon foot by military friends whom he had
made at Berlin, failed only because he was a republican.
Afterwards he became aid to Governor Allston of South Carolina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
and more recently to Governor Pickens. Upon the
breaking out of the war between Sardinia and Austria, Colonel
Pettigrew at once arranged his private business and
hastened to obtain position in the army under General Marmora.</p>

<p>His application to Count Cavour was favorably received,
but after consideration his offer was declined on the ground
that the event of the battle of Solferino had rendered further
fighting improbable. He was greatly disappointed, as his
reception had inspired him with hopes of seeing active service
in the Sardinian army with rank, at least as high as that of a
colonel. Availing himself, however, of his unexpected
leisure, he revisited Spain, and after a stay of a few months
returned to South Carolina. The fruits of this second visit
were collected by him into a volume entitled <cite>Spain and
Spaniards</cite>, which he printed, for the inspection of his friends,
in 1860. It will be found to be a thoughtful, spirited, and
agreeable record of his impressions of that romantic land. At
the opening of the present war, Colonel Pettigrew, as aid to
Governor Pickens, took a prominent part in the operations at
Charleston. He was at that time also colonel of a rifle regiment,
in which he was much interested, and which became
conspicuous amongst the military organizations around
Charleston in the winter of 1860-'61. As commander of
this body he received the surrender of Castle Pinckney, and
subsequently held himself in readiness to storm Fort Sumter,
in case it had not been surrendered after bombardment. Later
in the spring, having failed to procure the incorporation of
his regiment into the army of the Confederate States, and
believing there was little chance of seeing active service in
South Carolina, he transferred himself to Hampton's legion
as a private, and early in the summer accompanied that corps
into Virginia. A few days afterwards he was recalled to the
service of his native State by an unsolicited election as Colonel
of the Twelfth Regiment of North Carolina volunteers, afterwards
the Twenty-second Regiment of North Carolina troops.
It had been Colonel Pettigrew's earnest wish to become connected
with the North Carolina army, so he at once accepted
the honorable position, and repaired to Raleigh, where his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
regiment was stationed in its camp of instruction. He devoted
his attention to its discipline with great assiduity, and
in the early days of August was ordered into Virginia. The
fall and winter of 1861 were spent by him near Evansport,
upon the Potomac. He gave his whole time and attention to
perfecting his regiment in the duties of soldiers. He fully
shared in every hardship that was incident to their situation.
In this new position Colonel Pettigrew became conspicuous for
another characteristic necessary to eminent success in every
department, but especially in that of military life. He was
an adept in the art of personally attaching to him the men
under his charge. Their enthusiasm knew no bounds. Their
confidence in his administration of the police of the camp was
perfect, and their assurance of his gallantry and skill unqualified.
He soon felt that he might rely upon his brave
men for all that was possible to soldiers. Being offered promotion
to the rank of brigadier, he declined it on the ground
that it would separate him from his regiment. Sometime
later, in the spring of 1862, an arrangement was made by
which the Twelfth Regiment was included in the brigade that
was tendered to him, and he no longer felt any difficulty in
accepting the promotion.</p>

<p>General Pettigrew shared in the march under General
Johnston into the Peninsula, and afterwards, in the retreat
upon Richmond. On the first day of June, 1862, in the
battle of Seven Pines, he was severely wounded by a ball
which passed transversely along the front of his throat and so
into the shoulder, cutting the nerves and muscles which
strengthen the right arm. This occurred in a charge which
he led with great gallantry. He was left upon the field for
dead, and recovered his consciousness only to find himself in
the hands of the enemy. Some weeks later his exchange was
effected, and being still an invalid, he was placed in command
at Petersburg. The exigencies of the service having required
his regiment to be transferred to another brigade, he found,
upon his return, that it had been placed under the gallant,
and now, alas! lamented, General Pender. By degrees a new
brigade assembled around General Pettigrew, and such was
his pains in its instruction, and such the desire among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
North Carolina soldiers to make part of his command, that
by the close of the year he was at the head of a brigade which,
in point of quality, numbers, and soldierly bearing, was equal
to any in the army. He commanded this brigade in repelling
the Federal raid into Martin county, late in the fall of 1862,
and again in General Foster's expedition against Goldsboro, in
December, 1862, and although the quick dexterity of the
enemy in falling back did not upon either occasion afford him
and his associates an opportunity of trying conclusions with
them, yet, upon both occasions the magnificent appearance of
Pettigrew's Brigade tended greatly to revive the spirit of a
community recently overrun by the enemy. He was also with
General D. H. Hill during the spring of this year, in his
attempt upon Washington in this State; and in the very brilliant
affair at Blount's Creek gave the public a taste of what
might be expected from his abilities when untrammeled by
the orders of a superior.</p>

<p>At the time of General Stoneman's raid on the north of
Richmond, General Pettigrew was ordered to the protection
of that city, and shortly afterwards took position at Hanover
Junction. His brigade subsequently made part of the Army
of Northern Virginia, and accompanied General Lee into
Pennsylvania. At the battle of Gettysburg he was in command
of Heth's Division, and won many laurels. His division
was greatly cut up. The loss of his brigade in killed
and wounded was so heavy as almost to destroy its organization.
He himself was wounded by a ball which broke one of
the bones of his hand. He regarded it so little as not to
leave the field. Moving afterwards with General Lee to
Hagerstown and the Potomac, it devolved upon General Pettigrew,
on the night of the 13th and the morning of the 14th
of July, to assist in guarding the passage of that part of the
army which recrossed at Falling Waters. About nine o'clock
in the morning of the latter day, having been in the saddle
all night, General Pettigrew and other officers had thrown
themselves upon the ground for a few moment's rest, when a
party of Federal cavalry rode into their midst. In the <i>mêlée</i>
which ensued, General Pettigrew was shot, the ball taking
effect in the abdomen and passing through his body. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
the enemy had been repulsed, he was taken up by his sorrowing
soldiers and carried across the river some seven miles into
Virginia, along the track of the army. Upon the next day
he was carried some fifteen miles further, to the house of Mr.
Boyd at Bunker Hill, where he received every attention of
which his situation allowed. Upon General Lee's expressing
great sorrow for the calamity, he said that his fate was no
other than one might reasonably anticipate upon entering the
army, and that he was perfectly willing to die for his country.
To the Rev. Mr. Wilmer he avowed a firm persuasion of the
truths of the Christian religion, and said that in accordance
with his belief he had, some years before, made preparations
for death, adding, that otherwise he would not have entered
the army. He lingered until the 17th, and then at twenty-five
minutes after six in the morning, died, quietly and without
pain. The expression of sympathy for his sad fate was
universal. Private soldiers from other commands, and distant
States, vied with his own in repeated inquiries after his
condition. Upon its way to Raleigh, his body was received
by the authorities and by the citizens everywhere with all
possible respect and attention. On the morning of Friday,
the 24th of July, the coffin, wrapped in the flag of the
country, and, adorned with wreaths of flowers and other
tributes of feminine taste and tenderness, lay in the rotunda
of the Capitol, where, within the year, had preceded him his
compatriots, Branch and Anderson. Later in the day the
State received his loved and honored remains into her bosom.</p>

<p>It was a matter of great gratification to North Carolina
when this son, after an absence of a few years, gladly returned
to her service. She views his career in arms with a just
pride. She will ever reckon him among the most precious of
her jewels; and will hold him forth as the fittest of all exemplars
to the coming generations of her young heroes. Chief
among his triumphs will it be reckoned that in the midst of his
elevation and of the high hopes which possessed his soul, he so
demeaned himself as to secure a place, hallowed by grief, in
many an humble heart throughout North Carolina. His
name is to be pronounced reverently and with tears by the
winter fireside of many a hut; and curious childhood will beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
to have often repeated the rude stories in which soldiers shall
celebrate his generosity, his impartiality, his courtesy, and
his daring. It is true that many eyes which flashed with enthusiasm
as their favorite urged his gray horse into the thick
of the battle, are forever dull upon the fatal hills of Pennsylvania;
but this will render his memory only the more dear to
the survivors; what of his fame was not theirs originally, they
will claim to have inherited from the dead around Gettysburg.</p>

<p>If this story has been properly told, little remains to be said
by way of comment. A young man of very rare accomplishments
and energy, fitted equally for the cloister of the scholar
and for the field of battle, has been snatched from our midst.
Admirably qualified to be of assistance to the country as a
soldier or as a statesman, General Pettigrew has been suddenly
removed at the very commencement, as it were, of his career.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ostendent terris hunc tantum fata, neque ultra<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Esse sinent.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although what he has achieved is sufficient for fame, that
which impresses the observer most forcibly is that such vast
preparation should, in the course of Providence, be defeated
of an opportunity for display at all commensurate with what
seemed its reasonable requirements. Under the circumstances,
his death looks like a prodigious waste of material. It adds a
striking illustration to that class of subjects which has always
been popular in poetry and in morals, whether heathen or
Christian. It appears very clearly that the Ruler of all things
is under no necessity to employ rare talents and acquirements
in the course of His awful administration, but, in the crisis of
great affairs, can lay aside a Pettigrew with as little concern
as any other instrument, even the meanest.</p>

<p>Upon some fitting occasion, no doubt, his friends will see
that the public is furnished with a more suitable and detailed
account of the preparation he had made to do high service to
his generation. It will then be better known that no vulgar
career of ambition, and no ordinary benefit to his country,
had presented itself to him as worthy of the aims and endowments
of James Johnston Pettigrew.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spencer's sketch was written in 1863 and published
in the <cite>Fayetteville Observer</cite>. It will also be found in her
<cite>Last Ninety Days of the War</cite>, as an appendix. Other
sketches since written may have added opinions, but very few
facts.</p>

<p>The stranger may ask, What has this young man done that
he should be placed by the side of Davie, Macon, Murphy,
Badger, and Ruffin? In intellectual grasp he was the equal
of any of them&mdash;probably the superior of all. As an original
thinker, as a practical investigator in new and untried fields,
it does not appear what he might have been.</p>

<p>He was on the crest of the highest wave of Southern valor
and patriotism as it swept over the mountains of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>In Longstreet's assault, in the third day's fight at Gettysburg
(which some Virginia historians, with amusing vanity,
call "Pickett's charge"), Pettigrew's command, Heth's Division,
bore the brunt of the enemy's resistance. Five of the
North Carolina regiments following Pettigrew had more men
killed than Pickett's fifteen. His own brigade (four regiments
at Gettysburg) carried into Longstreet's assault about fourteen
hundred and eighty men; its loss in killed and wounded
was four hundred and forty-five.</p>

<p>This same brigade, Pettigrew in command, held the pivot
of the first day's fight, but at a fearful cost. Out of the
twenty-two hundred engaged it lost six hundred and sixty
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>In this brigade was the famous Twenty-sixth North Carolina
Regiment, under Harry K. Burgwyn, which lost in the
first day's fight five hundred and eighty-eight men killed and
wounded out of a total of eight hundred and in Longstreet's
assault one hundred and twenty of the remnant, the greatest
loss and the greatest percentage of loss of any regiment in
either army in any battle during the Civil War. Its gallant
colonel (Burgwyn) was among the last of fifteen color-bearers
who fell with the flag in their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first day's fight Pettigrew was engaged with the
famous "Iron Brigade," in which was the Twenty-fourth
Michigan, facing the Twenty-sixth North Carolina in the open
field at close range, gradually getting closer as the Federals
slowly retired through field and woods for an hour and a half,
until finally, and before the Twenty-fourth broke, they were
within one hundred feet of each other, at which range they
continued for twenty or thirty minutes. Captain J. J. Davis
(afterwards Associate Justice of our Supreme Court) was an
eye-witness and participant. He says: "The advantage was
everywhere with the Confederate side, and I aver that this
was greatly, if not chiefly, due to Pettigrew's Brigade and its
brave commander. The bravery of that knightly soldier and
elegant scholar, as he galloped along the line in the hottest of
the fight, cheering on his men, cannot be effaced from my
memory."</p>

<p>After this frightful day's work he was chosen to lead
Heth's Division in Longstreet's assault. And though
wounded in this assault by a grape-shot through his hand,
he it was who, on the retreat of Lee's army, was chosen to
command the rear guard, which consisted of his own shattered
brigade and another. This was the duty that Napoleon
assigned to Marshal Ney, "the bravest of the brave." And
it was in the discharge of this duty that Pettigrew lost his life.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Lilly, of Concord, N. C., an eye-witness and the
physician who was with General Pettigrew when he got his
death-wound, at my request gives me a short account taken
from his diary kept at the time:</p>

<p>"General Pettigrew was carrying his wounded hand in a
sling.... On the night of July 13th we started on our march
to the river. It was raining, and very dark, so that we proceeded
very slowly. On the morning of the 14th, General
Pettigrew, with his and General Archer's Brigades, was left as
rear guard while the wagons and artillery were crossing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
river on the pontoon bridge. While our men were lying down
a large body of cavalry appeared in our rear. A squadron
from the main body came riding up to our line. They were
at first thought to be our men retiring before the main body
of the advancing enemy. When near us a small United
States flag was recognized, and they were in our midst before
we fired on them. General Pettigrew's horse threw him, as
he had only the use of one hand. He then began to snap his
pistol at one of them, who turned and shot him in the abdomen.
The General's pistol did not fire, as the powder was
wet from the heavy rain. Nearly the entire squadron was
killed or captured. We put General Pettigrew on a stretcher
and carried him over the river at once. I advised him to
remain in a house, and assured him that his only chance for
life was in his being entirely quiet. He refused, saying he
would rather die than fall into the hands of the enemy. We
brought him in an ambulance to Bunker Hill and put him
into Mr. Boyd's house, where he died at 6:30 <small>A. M.</small> on the
morning of July 17th."</p>

<p>Why was it that this young man (who rarely went into a
fight that he did not get hit) was preferred for responsible
and dangerous commands before the officers trained at West
Point? He had the genius for war and the spirit of a hero-martyr.</p>

<p>In the blood of his crucified cause was written the mightiest
protest ever filed for the judgment of posterity against the
class legislation, the centralization and the aggrandizement of
the General Government in copartnership with the preferred
and protected States&mdash;a copartnership out of which has been
spawned a still more unholy alliance with the corporations
and moneyed institutions which have their roots in those
States and in foreign countries.</p>

<p>Not in blood, we hope, but nevertheless bravely and patriotically,
let the young men of this day and generation strive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
free our Union from the domination of domestic traitors and
entangling alliances with foreign foes.</p>

<p>I have selected two short extracts from his book, <cite>Spain and
the Spaniards</cite>, as giving a hint of his style and habits of
thought. The book was intended for private circulation
among his friends, and was written, doubtless, with the usual
speed of young authors. It indicates considerable learning
and research, but its arrangement is somewhat crude and its
style not always sufficiently careful and clear. One might
well wish that he had devoted his life to literature, but his
talents were so varied and versatile it is hard to say where he
would have most excelled.</p>

<h3><a name="CHARACTER" id="CHARACTER"></a>THE CHARACTER OF THE BRITISH.</h3>

<p>"All this talk (that our western civilization and government
is nothing but a development of English ideas) is beginning
to make the Europeans believe that we consider ourselves
under some obligations to sympathize with and sustain
Anglo-Saxonism, the real truth being that there is a far greater
sympathy between the French and us than between their
neighbors and us. We are essentially democratic; they abhor
and detest the idea. The most miserable creature in England
would spurn liberty if accompanied by equality; for he
thinks there must be some poor devil, more miserable than
himself, over whom he can tyrannize. We acknowledge and
are in favor of securing to every one his just rights in the
political system; whereas, exactly the contrary holds in the
Anglo-Saxon, who follows the old parable of giving to him
that hath and taking from him that hath not even that which
he hath. The universal tendency is to yield power to those
above and to keep the lower class pressed to the earth. I,
therefore, see little to justify the attempt of Mr. Bright to
transplant our institutions into England. He forgets that the
Americans&mdash;it is useless to investigate the causes why&mdash;are a
race of higher and more delicate organization, and can be entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
with liberty because they can appreciate it. The common
Englishman would only covet the privilege of suffrage
in order that he might sell his vote at its market value. He
needs a sort of master, and delights in having one. Universal
suffrage in England, with due submission, seems to me the
craziest idea that ever entered into the brain of a statesman.
But Mr. Bright has a meagre following, for the English people
know themselves too well to indulge in such a Utopian experiment.
Not content with this, they kindly volunteer to lecture
us upon the errors of our system of society&mdash;for it is a difference
of society as well as of government&mdash;and pronounce
republicanism a failure because we prefer to confine government
within the strictest limits necessary for the objects of its
institution, and perhaps find King Log more suitable for the
purpose than King Stork. Even Mr. Macaulay has favored
us with a "preachment," founded upon such a strange confusion
as to seem to belie the aphorism that history is wisdom
teaching by experience, and that its votaries should consequently
be the wisest of statesmen. England is a conglomeration
of monopolies. The land is a monopoly of a few
thousands; the government of a few hundreds. The whole
number of capitalists does not exceed a few millions. All
below is a toiling, ignorant, vicious, discontented multitude,
who know not one week where they will find bread for the
next. Such is their system, and were America like England,
Mr. Macaulay would be justifiable in supposing the cause of
republicanism hopeless. But what class in America enjoys
a monopoly of the pleasures of life? Is not every avenue open
to the most unfriended capacity? Do not all receive the
benefits of education? Can not, and have not, the poorest
boys occupied the Presidential chair? Have our great statesmen,
our millionaires, been, for the most part, the children of
even competency? Owing to the equality which reigns
throughout our ideas and institutions, is it not in the power of
every honest laborer to make provision against the contingencies
of old age, and do not most of them make such provision?
Whence, then, is to come this army of grim, despairing,
famished workmen, who, having nothing, hoping
nothing, without past or future, are to wage an eternal warfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
against the order of society? Is there, then, no middle
ground between a savorless communism and the despotism of
capital? Are there no checks and balances in nature? Do
freedom, equality, education, an honorable inculcation of industry
effect nothing? It is provoking to hear such solemn
inconsequences from a really great man.</p>

<p>The disposition, too, to place a money value upon everything,
the real cause of their difficulties, is peculiar to the
Anglo-Saxons, and an anomaly in the present age of the
world. In the military profession, where, of all others, individual
merit should be the sole passport to distinction, commissions
are still bought and sold. Throughout the country
money is imperatively required for every position of eminence.
The records of the House of Lords contain the strange case of
a duke who was expelled for no other crime than his poverty.
Men of the first abilities are deterred from accepting the peerage
because they have not amassed money enough to save
them from the humiliating and disgraceful position of a poor
gentleman. We Americans like money, not because it is
money, or because it brings position or respect, but because it
gratifies bodily desires. It would be thought an astonishing
thing with us if the Presidential Electors were to inspect the
pockets of the candidate rather than his head and his heart;
or if, in 1848, Mr. Cass had been recommended on account of
his wealth, or General Taylor had sold out his commission&mdash;things
perfectly consonant with Anglo-Saxon ideas. Yet the
greatness of England is due in considerable part to this very
state of affairs, and any attempt to alter it may involve the
downfall of her power. The natural rulers are the aristocracy&mdash;and
the Anglo-Saxon gentleman is certainly one of the
best qualified persons in Europe to govern Anglo-Saxons&mdash;but
all below bear the impress of an inferior class, a strange
combination of servility with tyranny. That there should be
any real sympathy between the great body of the two nations
is as little to be desired as expected.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken of the want of sympathy between us
in the weaker points of character, justice requires me to confess
that there is an equal absence of resemblance in the virtues.
The Englishman certainly does possess bulldog courage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
His officers may be ignorant of the science of war, but he,
nevertheless, fights to the last, nor is he subject either to the
exhilaration of success or the depression of defeat. He is conservative
by nature and abhors humbugs and humbuggery.
The middle classes, and particularly the country gentleman,
are worthy of their position. The men of this rank are true
and the women virtuous. Reserved in intercourse and unamiable
toward their own countrymen, they seem to be courteous
to foreigners and even to each other when the social
barrier is broken through; but these do not compose the nation.
In discussing national relations it is not the merits and
demerits of one class alone that are to be considered, but the
bearing of the whole.</p>

<p>The increase of steam and the facility of communication
and the little leaven of Anglo-Saxonism unfortunately left
among us, has of late years caused many Americans to look
up to England as the <em>mother country</em>, as the phrase goes.
Though, perhaps, not one in ten of those who use the expression
so frequently has any great amount of the much prized
fluid in his veins. The manner in which the homage is
received beyond the water depends very much upon the state
of relations with France. As the one goes up, the other goes
down. The difference between the conduct of the English
toward America now, and its conduct in 1850, is astonishing.
Then France was torn internally, scarcely able to
maintain domestic tranquillity, and powerless for any offensive
action. Europe was just beginning to stagger weakly along,
as if from a bed of sickness. England and Russia, alone, of
the great powers, had stood the storm unbent. Under this
state of things America was a presumptuous youngster, to be
snubbed upon every opportune occasion. The Yankees (as
they persist in calling the whole nation) were described in
Europe as lank, nasal-twanging barbarians, very good for
accumulating money and manufacturing wooden nutmegs,
but worthy only of a place in the kitchen of the civilized
world. The Brussels-carpeted parlor, Christendom, was not
to be defiled with their presence. The newspapers never
wearied of ringing the changes upon American shortcomings.
Our self-government and liberty were held up as empty bubbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
on the point of bursting. The plain and unflattering
truth being that the English have a profound contempt for us,
and it is impossible to blame them for it, when we remember
the servility and utter abnegation of manhood that characterize
so many of us in the presence of a live lord. They have
eagerly embraced every opportunity of kicking and cuffing
us, yet we whine at their feet; how could they do otherwise
than despise us? Since that time, however, certain changes
have taken place in the world. The distracted French
Republic has given way to a powerfully organized empire,
with a chief capable of planning, and an army and navy capable
of executing any enterprise, however gigantic. The first
warning given of this change was in 1851, on the Greek question,
when the President of the French Republic checked
Lord Palmerston, and gave England to understand that her
course of proceeding in foreign domineering must be altered
or a war with France would follow in a fortnight. We all
remember the salutary effect of that warning, and Palmerston's
capital "bottle-holding" speech. The doctrine of a balance
of power upon the ocean as well as the land has been again
spoken of in high places. The ghost of Waterloo, from being
a source of unmingled pride and gratification and boasting,
has come to cause as many terrors as that of Banquo. An unexpected
consequence has been that the manner of speaking of
America has altered apace. It is "our cousins beyond the
water" now, and "Brother Jonathan." An American is appealed
to and asked whether he will allow the "mother
country" to be crushed, the "Protestant religion to be destroyed,"
etc. All this happened before, and if the government
of Louis Napoleon were supplanted by a weak monarchy,
the present good feeling of "our dear cousins" would
disappear as rapidly as their fears.</p>

<p>In truth, opposition to the advancement of the United
States, whether material or intellectual, is the normal condition
of England. We have suffered from it ever since
the foundation of our government, and will continue to do so,
except when the fear of invasion causes a temporary change
in her policy; for selfishness, an utter, unholy and inconceivable
desire to sacrifice the happiness and prosperity of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
other country to her own even most trifling advantage, is her
invariable rule of action. The English quarrel among themselves
about the length of a bishop's gown, or the cut of a
guardsman's hat, or great constitutional questions, but there
is never a difference of action on this point; and any statesman
who dared raise a voice in behalf of justice and honor in
foreign relations could not be returned from a single constituency
in England. Witness poor Bright and Cobden in the
Chinese war. Woe to any nation that trusts her friendship.</p>

<h3><a name="SEVILLE" id="SEVILLE"></a>AN EVENING AT SEVILLE.</h3>

<p>About nine o'clock in summer, the whole of Seville issues
forth to enjoy the evening air on the Plaza Isabel, which is
the favorite promenade at that hour. So, following the current,
I found myself in a large parallelogram, surrounded by
stately buildings in the modern style, and half-filled with an
innumerable throng of all classes, some seated, some walking.
Most of the men were smoking and most of the women fanning
themselves, with occasional intermixtures of conversation;
but the great occupation of every one is to look and be
looked at....</p>

<p>A public promenade is indispensable to every Spanish city,
however small, and every Spaniard is sure to pass there some
portion of the week. Particularly is this the case in Andalusia
and Valencia. The unbroken clear weather, continuing
during a large part of the year, converts the occasional constitutional
stroll into a daily habit, and an afternoon or evening
walk is as much a matter of course as attendance at mass.
Fortunately for strangers, they have thus, during spring and
summer, an opportunity for seeing a considerable portion of
the population without the necessity of resorting to letters of
introduction, which involve the sacrifice of more time than a
passing traveler can spare. Seville is the city where this,
as all other national customs, is seen in its greatest perfection....</p>

<p>The night was Spanish, and who can describe the glories
of a Spanish summer night on the banks of the Guadalquivir?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
The mellow lustre of the moon seemed to have overflowed the
earth, and the blue vault of heaven had given even to the
stone buildings around an appearance of liquid silver. It
was as though the air itself had a visible tangible substance,
and we were floating upon the bosom of an enchanted ocean.
The lamps served but for ornament, and stood like little
points of burnished gold. Not a cloud obscured the sky.
Odoriferous breezes from the south wafted gently over, as if
fearing to embrace too roughly the fair cheeks that sought
their wooing. A quadruple row of chairs offered repose to
the indolent or weary, and from time to time some young
lady would take compassion upon a score of admirers, by
remaining where all might approach within sound of her
voice; but the more interesting part of the assemblage was
generally to be found on the promenade.</p>

<p>The beauty of Spanish women has ever been a subject of
admiration to all who are endowed with a perception of the
lovely. Yet, while acknowledging its irresistible power, there
is nothing so difficult as to explain the fascination which it
exercises; for, unlike the rest of their sex, the daughters of
Andalusia owe nothing to those artificial processes which may
be said to form a part of the female education elsewhere.
Their taste in dress is excellent, when combined with simplicity,
as is generally the case; for they have by nature very
little disposition to the variety of colors, which appears to be
the ruling passion of Parisian circles. The universal costume
in winter, and the usual one out of doors in all seasons, is a
dark colored skirt called a <i>basquiña</i>, fitting close around the
waist and extending to the feet, which are thus concealed. It
is sometimes kept in place by leaden pellets affixed to the
border. The same innate sense of delicacy, or, perhaps, an
intuitive knowledge of the weakness of men in believing no
charms equal to hidden charms, preserves them from those
fearful exposures of neck and shoulders, which so shocked the
Japanese. A delicate satin slipper encases a foot that would
not crush a daisy. From the top of the comb, if one be worn,
gracefully fall the mantilla's folds across a gently budding
breast, where it is confined by the fingers of the wearer's left-hand,
or at times the veil is thrown forward over the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>From the hair, massed above the temples, stealthily peeps
a rose, as if hesitating to venture its humble beauties beside
such loveliness. Two curls&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guedejas, caracoles de armor</i>&mdash;bear
it company. A fan completes her costume. Thus
armed, the maids of the Guadalquivir go forth to conquer the
world.</p>

<p>The use of the black veil seems traditional in Spain, since
it is mentioned by the Roman geographers as a part of the
ancient costume existing in those provinces which had not
fully adopted the dress of the conqueror; and they describe
it as frequently thrown forward over the face in the same
style.... The mantilla is peculiarly becoming to the
Spanish style of features, while the French hat presents the
most odious and hideous contrast conceivable; the former lends
additional attractions; the latter destroys those which already
exist. One may be insensible to everything else, but the
mantilla is irresistible. A <i>basquiña</i>, a Cinderella slipper, a
mantilla or a veil, a rose and a fan, are all that any Andaluza
needs to bring the world to her feet.</p>

<p>But the fan! the magic fan! who shall describe its wonderful
powers? Who can sound the depths of its mysteries?
Every movement of this potent wand is fraught with happiness
or misery. In their hands it positively speaks, and its gentle
recognitions are far more winning than any assertions of the
tongue. It is said to have a language, a sort of alphabet of its
own, but that is doubtful. Its utterances are of the magnetic
character, which need no interpretation, and are felt rather
than learnt. The art of managing it was always to me an
unfathomable science, and though I embraced every opportunity
of becoming a proficient, and actually took two formal
lessons, I failed utterly of success. It must be said, however,
that my instructor had learnt by intuition, but unfortunately
was not able to teach by the same method. I was always
told there was only one way of opening it, yet there are certainly
five, for the theory is almost as difficult as the practice.
But having, by dint of hard study, acquired, as you fondly
imagine, the requisite theoretical knowledge, you desire to see
it embodied in action. Your instructor shows how the fingers
are placed. You are then told to do "so"; whirr! goes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
fan, and it is all over before your eyes have caught the first
movement. A gentleman present at my discomfiture, consoled
me by saying that he would not respect a man who
could acquire the art; that in men's hands it was a practical
instrument for putting the air in motion. The ladies certainly
do not so regard it.</p>

<p>I had been apprehensive lest this costume, rendered so
poetical by the descriptions of travelers and the dreams of
romancers, were not the true secret of the admiration which
I had formerly carried away across the Pyrenees, and that it
was a reflected, semi-poetic, semi-romantic, at all events, unsubstantial
conception. Such is not the case. On the present
occasion the prevailing color, in accordance with the season
was white, and the mantilla was replaced by a simple lace veil,
so that there is certainly some external attraction independent
of dress. I attribute it to the combination of personal beauty,
such as the world cannot surpass, with a grace of movement,
an innate, inalienable elegance of manner, which no education
can give and no words describe. An Andaluza is born,
not made. Not too tall and never dumpy (horrible word),
her person is so exquisitely proportioned that, without some
measure of comparison, you would form no opinion as to her
real size. An elegant fullness preserves her alike from the
scrawny penury of the English or the corpulency of the Italians.
Her lofty brow justifies her sparkling wit, and the delicate
organization of her feelings and intellect is in harmony
with the finely chiseled features. Luxuriant masses of dark
glossy hair, parted slightly on one side, and nobly arched eyebrows,
are a fit setting to a rich southern complexion, not of
sickly yellow, but of a clear olive tinge, through which the
timid blood, with every emotion, mantles to the surface. The
pride of her beauty is the large, lustrous, almond-shaped, velvety
eye, half covered with silken lashes, as if to screen her
admirers from the danger of being consumed; but when
aroused into activity, flashing forth pride, interest, inexhaustible
love, with a fire more irresistible than that of a thousand
suns. Then it is that, with an imperious wave of the fan, she
bids you plunge into a maelstrom of vipers, and you obey.</p>

<p>There is a widely diffused, but very erroneous belief among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
us that every Spaniard has perforce black eyes and a dark
complexion. Such is far from being true, even in Andalusia.
Ladies of the better class, who are not exposed to the sun or
wind, have beautifully clear complexions, though brunette.
In Ronda, blue eyes form the majority, and they are by no
means uncommon in other provinces. But the Spanish blonde
is still a Spaniard, and her type of beauty very different from
the insipid combination which often passes under that name
in the north. There is the same smothered fire, the same
deep expression in the eye, the same richness of complexion,
which, in union with raven tresses, form an exquisite picture.
Light-haired persons, <i>rubias</i>, are rarer, and of course much
admired to look at, though every one falls in love with their
dark-haired rivals. Of the luxuriance and elegance of their
hair the ladies are justly proud, and no pains are spared to
render it as beautiful as possible. The time devoted to this
object is sacred in all classes, and if, in response to an inquiry
or request, the ominous reply is heard, "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">hombre! estamos
ocupadas con el pelo</i>," it is useless to remain. Nothing short
of another invasion of the Moors could arouse them. During
the civil war, Zumalacarregui, or Merino, for it is narrated of
both, placed death for the men and loss of their hair for the
women, upon the same footing, and found them equally efficacious
punishments.</p>

<p>Spanish girls are taught to walk gracefully, too, as all girls
should be, and since the narrowness of the streets prevents the
general use of carriages, and the arms of gentlemen are seldom
offered, and never accepted, they avoid falling into the tottering
shuffle, which is produced by the opposite customs. The
walk of the Seville ladies is something peculiar to Andalusia.
That they take steps is firmly believed because required by the
anatomical construction of mankind, but in their case the
belief is the result of induction, not of ocular perception.
They glide over the earth as though supported by unseen
hands, and disappear from your sight ere you can believe that
they are actually moving.</p>

<p>The Andalusian foot is a marvel, both for size and beauty.
A lady will wear with ease the slipper of an ordinary girl of
fourteen. If any artificial means are used, the pressure must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
be very slight, as the appearance is perfectly natural, notwithstanding
the fact that they seldom adopt any other means
of locomotion. The development of the English <em>understanding</em>
is a subject of perpetual wonderment on the Guadalquivir,
where they are accustomed to compare its covering to a twelve-oared
boat.</p>

<p>The graceful walk of the Sevillians is not more peculiar to
them than the noble carriage of the head, due, doubtless, in
some degree, to the absence of those fragile yet cumbrous
ornaments which force others to assume a stiff and constrained
position. It gives them an air of haughtiness by no means
disagreeable, however, as you are quite ready to admit their
unapproachable superiority before they assert it. Every Andaluza
has two points of beauty&mdash;fine eyes and hair. Then
she may have a good complexion, and she is almost certain to
be graceful. If to these she unite wit and cultivation, who are
so daring as to deny her preeminence? Progress, perhaps
mere change, is desirable in many things in Spain, but that
Heaven may preserve her fair daughters from the hand of
innovation is the prayer of native and foreigner alike. It is
scarcely possible, that the best laid schemes of any power on
earth could effect an improvement.</p>

<p>Among the glorious number of heroic spirits who laid down
their lives for this pre-doomed undertaking [the secession of
the Confederate States] not one was more conspicuous for
courage and loyalty, and but few, if any, for skill and leadership,
than the subject of this sketch, General William Dorsey
Pender. He was born in Edgecombe county, N. C., on the
6th of February, 1834, at the country home of his father,
James Pender, Esq. His paternal ancestry is of ancient
English stock, the name being as old as English history itself.
The first of the family to come to America was Edwin, who,
in the reign of Charles II., settled near Norfolk, Virginia.
A descendant of the same name, grandfather of General
Pender, removed from Norfolk to Edgecombe, on Town
Creek, where he owned and died possessed of large landed
interests and slaves. On one of these plantations, inherited
by his father, General Pender was born. His mother was
Sarah Routh, a sister of the mother of the late Hon. R. R.
Bridgers, and the daughter of William Routh, Esq., of Tidewater,
Virginia.</p>

<p>General Pender lived where he was born until he was
fifteen years of age, when he entered, as a clerk, the store of
his brother, Mr. Robert D. Pender, in Tarboro. This employment
was distasteful to him from the first. The martial
spirit was already strongly developed in him, and the opportunity
soon presented itself for him to begin a military education
and training. He entered the Military Academy at
West Point as a cadet on the first of July, 1850, having been
recommended as a suitable candidate by the Hon. Thomas
Ruffin, who was then the member of Congress from his district.
The friendship of Mr. R. R. Bridgers, which lasted
through life, procured for him the appointment. He was
graduated in 1854, standing nineteenth in his class. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
class were G. W. Custis Lee, Stephen D. Lee, J. E. B.
Stuart and other distinguished military men. As cadet he
was modest and unassuming in his intercourse with his fellows,
respectful to his instructors and tractable to the discipline
of the institution. Upon his graduation he was
assigned to the First Artillery as Brevet Second Lieutenant
and the same year was made Second Lieutenant of the Second
Artillery. In the year 1855 he was transferred, at his own
request, to the First Regiment of Dragoons, and in 1858 was
promoted to a first lieutenancy. From the time he entered
the dragoons he saw service in the field in all its phases, camp,
frontier, and scouting; fighting in New Mexico, California,
Washington and Oregon. He was engaged in many skirmishes,
and in as many as three battles with the Indians&mdash;one
of the engagements being with the Apaches at Amalgré Mountain,
on March 20, 1856; another at the Four Lakes, September
1, 1858, and the other on the Spokane Plains, September
3, 1858. He took a conspicuous part in these engagements,
and was mentioned with credit in the reports of them. Lieutenant
Lawrence Kip, in his <cite>Army Life on the Pacific</cite>, narrates
the following incident which occurred at the battle of
Spokane Plains: "Lieutenant Pender, while in the woods,
returning from the rear, where he had been on duty connected
with ordering up the balance of the troops, was suddenly
attacked by an Indian chief. To his dismay, the
Lieutenant discovered that his sabre had become entangled
in the scabbard and would not draw. Quick as thought
one hand grasped the savage's arm, the other his neck, and
in this manner, hugging him close and galloping into ranks,
he lifted him from his horse and hurled him back among
the men, who soon dispatched him." He was made Adjutant
of the First Dragoons November 8, 1860, and served
with that rank, with the headquarters at San Francisco, until
January 31, 1861, when he was detached and ordered to
report at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on recruiting service.</p>

<p>On the 3d of March, 1859, he had married Miss Mary
Frances Shepperd, daughter of the Hon. Augustine H. Shepperd,
at Good Spring, the country-seat of the bride's father,
near Salem, North Carolina. Shortly after the marriage he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
returned to his command, then in Washington Territory,
his wife accompanying him and remaining with him until
they returned to the east, arriving at Washington in the
latter part of February, 1861. There they remained a few
days, and on the 3d of March, the day before Mr. Lincoln
was inaugurated, they left for North Carolina. This short
stay at Washington at this juncture was a crisis in the
young officer's life. He had seen a sectional feeling arise
in the army. He now found the people divided. The
Confederate Government was already established; troops had
been organized and drilled in the South and Fort Sumter
invested. He was perplexed as to what he ought to do;
whether to continue in the service of the United States or
resign his commission; for in case of war he could not take
part against the South, and this would be required of him
if he held his commission in the army. He became satisfied,
after considering carefully the situation and observing
closely the tendency of affairs, that war was inevitable, and
from his knowledge of the character and temper of the two
sections he knew the war would be a terrible one. He determined
to cast his lot with his people of the South, and on
the 21st of March resigned his commission in the army, and
immediately offered his services to the Confederate Government
at Montgomery. He was appointed captain in the
artillery service of the provisional army, but was shortly afterwards
sent by the government to Baltimore to take charge of
the Confederate recruiting depot at that place.</p>

<p>The time has passed when the motives of the men who
resigned their commissions in the armies of the United States
and took service afterwards in the Confederate armies can
be impugned. Impartial history has pronounced their conduct
natural, consistent, and sincere. In this connection it
is interesting to recall a sentence from the memorable address
of Mr. Edmunds in the United States Senate in 1883, on the
life and character of Senator B. H. Hill: "The notion of
fidelity to one's own State, whether her cause be thought wise
and right or not, is almost a natural instinct; and whether it
be defensible on broad grounds or not, who does not sympathize
with it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first week of May, 1861, when North Carolina began
to organize her volunteer troops, Captain Pender returned
and entered her service at the "Old Fair Grounds," near Raleigh,
Governor Ellis appointing him to drill and instruct the
officers of the companies of the First Regiment&mdash;the Bethel
Regiment. After that regiment was dispatched to Virginia
he was assigned to duty as Commandant of the Camp of Instruction
at Garysburg, and, upon the formation there of the
Third Regiment of Volunteers, was elected its colonel on
the 16th of May, 1861. At this time he was twenty-seven
years old, about five feet ten inches in height, well formed
and straight; graceful in his carriage; with large, lustrous,
dark eyes, dark-brown hair, an olive complexion, head
almost faultless in shape, a mouth clear cut, and lips firmly
compressed, and a voice soft, low, and distinct. The combined
dignity and ease of his manner charmed all who
came about him. The sweet modesty of his unassuming
bearing was so striking that it won all to him; and this
characteristic is always mentioned, even now, by those who
knew him, as one of his most attractive charms; and it underwent
no diminution in after years when he had won
such distinguished military honors. His modest and unassuming
character was not always understood by those who did
not know him well. The following is an instance: He had
fought more than half a dozen pitched battles under General
Jackson before the two ever met socially. One day
General Jackson said to Major Avery, who was well acquainted
with them both: "What sort of a man is General Pender?
I'm embarrassed at his never having been to see me. I
know he is a fine soldier, gallant and skillful on the field,
and his troops are well disciplined. I never fail to be impressed
with his camps; they are always clean, orderly and
comfortable. I've made it a rule, though, never to recommend
an officer for promotion unless I have a personal and
social acquaintance with him, and this will some day embarrass
me."</p>

<p>However, from the beginning of his career to the end of
it he knew the value of discipline, and though of a kind
and gentle disposition he was firm in the management of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
men. Throughout the entire period of his service the camps
of his troops always showed the marks of order and system
and the men the effects of training and discipline.</p>

<p>General W. G. Lewis, in a letter to Mr. D. W. Gilliam,
says, after noting a visit paid by himself to General Pender
shortly after the battle of Fredericksburg: "He received me
most cordially and courteously, and I had a very pleasant
visit and one of profit to me, as I saw plainly in his camps
the results of true military discipline and careful attention
from headquarters. His camp was a model of cleanliness,
regularity and good order; his sentinels and guard saluted
in strict military style; all officers wore the badges of their
rank. I was particularly struck with this, as it was not, by
far, universal in the Army of Northern Virginia." Discipline
was enforced, as he often said, for the comfort and
safety of his men, and because the fiery gallantry of the
Southern soldier would be uselessly expended unless it was
systematically and scientifically directed; and he used to
say that discipline was a protection to the good soldier, in
that it forced the doubtful one to the performance of his
duty, and thus reduced the work and the peril of the former.</p>

<p>Colonel Pender, with his regiment, was near Suffolk, Va.,
until after the 15th of August, 1861, when he took command
of Fisher's famous Sixth Regiment at Manassas. He was
appointed colonel of the Sixth by Governor Clark, on the
unanimous petition of its officers. That appointment, at
that time, was the highest compliment that could have been
paid to a North Carolinian. None but those who are old
enough to remember those days can appreciate what honor
it was to be accounted worthy to command the men whom
Fisher led at Manassas; though that battle was full of all
sorts of blunders, strategical and tactical, in the Confederate
commanders, and turned out a barren victory, the troops
behaved admirably, and this regiment as well as the best.</p>

<p>The Confederate army occupied about its original position
near Manassas until March, 1862, when it was transferred,
under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston,
to the Peninsula to meet McClellan's "On to Richmond"
from that direction. As the Federals advanced the Confederates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
retired upon Richmond, taking position on the south
side of the Chickahominy, and from two to five miles on the
east and north of the city. In the last week in May two
Federal corps, Keyes' and Heintzelman's, crossed that stream
and entrenched themselves across the Williamsburg stage
road, near Seven Pines. General Johnston ordered the attack
of the 31st May on the enemy's left. General Keyes, in his
report of the battle, says: "The left of my line was all protected
by white oak swamps, but the right was on ground so
favorable to the approach of the enemy and so far from the
Chickahominy that if Johnston had attacked an hour or two
earlier than he did I could have made but a feeble defense,
comparatively, and every man of us would have been killed,
captured or driven into the swamps or river before assistance
could have reached us." Owing to misunderstandings and
jealousies between the Confederate general officers only five
brigades of the twenty-three which were ordered for the
attack on the enemy's left were used in that attack, and some
of them fought knee and waist deep in mud and water in
a white oak swamp trying to get at an enemy entrenched on
high ground. There was great gallantry on the part of the
Confederates, and the carnage was dreadful. General D. H.
Hill, who made the morning attack with his division, after
numerous repulses in and around the swamp finally carried
the enemy's position from the front&mdash;Couch's Division of
Keyes' Corps falling back northward to and beyond Fair
Oaks, a station on the Richmond and York River Railroad.
From a point just outside Fair Oaks, on the north, there is
an intersection at right angles of the Nine-Mile Road to
Richmond and a road from Grape Vine Bridge on the
Chickahominy to the station. On the Grape Vine Bridge
road, about a thousand yards from Fair Oaks, Couch's Division
halted and formed a line facing toward the south,
information having been received that Sumner's Corps had
crossed the river at Grape Vine Bridge and was advancing
to the assistance of the Union troops. About 5 o'clock in the
afternoon Colonel Pender, with his Sixth Regiment, arrived
at Fair Oaks from toward Richmond, on the Nine-Mile road,
in advance of Whiting's Brigade. Line of battle having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
been instantly formed facing to the south, the regiment,
without support and under direct orders from either General
Whiting or General G. W. Smith, went rapidly forward.
After an advance of probably a third of a mile without coming
up with the enemy, Colonel Pender discovered a large
force of Federals in the act of forming a line from column by
companies, near the Grape Vine Bridge road and well to his
left and rear. They had seen him in his perilous position,
and were preparing to capture or destroy him. There really
seemed no chance of escape; but as quick as lightning, and
with coolness equaling his bravery, the order "By the left
flank, file left, double quick!" rang out in as clear and musical
a voice as ever was heard on battlefield. The old regiment,
the best drilled and disciplined in the army of Northern
Virginia, moved as if on parade, and before the enemy had
completed their formation it was upon them, pouring volley
after volley into their very faces; and under the suddenness
and fury of the attack the foe staggered and reeled, while the
glorious soldier withdrew his men and rejoined his brigade,
which was just coming up. Our hero was here like Jackson
in quickness of comprehension and promptness of decision; he
was like Soult in his tactical skill; he was like Junot in his
fiery onslaught. There never was a more courageous and
skillful movement made on any field. In the attack by Whiting's
Brigade, which almost immediately followed upon Colonel
Pender's affair, the brigade was repulsed and the troops
retired in great disorder. Colonel Froebel, of General Whiting's
staff, who was present, in his report of the battle says that
Colonel Pender reformed the broken regiments and restored
the line by his courage and coolness. Mr. Davis was present
and witnessed Colonel Pender's behavior, and said to him on
the field, "<em>General</em> Pender, I salute you!" General Stephen
D. Lee thus writes: "I was on the battlefield of Fair Oaks;
saw him (General Pender) and conversed with him before
and after the battle. He expressed his great satisfaction to
me that he was literally made a general on the field of battle
for gallant and meritorious conduct just performed, and said
that it reminded him of such cases in European armies, where
such recognitions of soldierly conduct were made."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>Three days afterwards he was put in command of Pettigrew's
Brigade (Pettigrew having been wounded and captured),
which he led through the Seven Days' fight around
Richmond. His commission as brigadier-general was handed
to him July 22, 1862, to date from June 3. His brigade was
composed of North Carolinians, the Thirteenth, Sixteenth,
Twenty-second, Thirty-fourth, and Thirty-eighth Regiments,
and General Pender commanded it until he was promoted.</p>

<p>General Johnston having been severely wounded in the
battle of the 31st, the command of the army was given to
General Lee. Within less than a month he concentrated
around Richmond the largest army the Confederacy ever
had in the field, composed of the very pick and flower of the
South. There was little discipline in that army, but there
were the highest personal courage and the greatest individuality
of character among the men. Its antagonist, the
Army of the Potomac, under General McClellan, though
possibly a little inferior in numbers, was thoroughly organized,
drilled, and equipped. On the 23d of June General
Jackson arrived at General Lee's headquarters, having left
his troops on the route from the Valley to join General Lee
in a contemplated attack upon McClellan's right. It was
agreed between the two generals that at sunrise on the morning
of the 26th Jackson's forces should attack the rear of the
Federal position at Mechanicsville and Beaver Dam, while
a part of Lee's army should make the attack there in front.
On the 25th, the divisions of the two Hills moved out, A. P.
Hill's down the Meadow Bridge and D. H. Hill's on the
Mechanicsville road. Jackson was waited for until about 3
o'clock of the afternoon of the 26th, when, not being heard
from, A. P. Hill impetuously began the attack from the
front, General Pender with his brigade being the first to
engage. He brushed back the enemy's advanced line to
their main one just behind and along Beaver Dam creek.
The position was entrenched and fortified with siege-guns,
as well as light artillery, while the creek just in front was
made hopelessly impassable by all manner of obstructions
placed there for that purpose. The approach was over an
exposed plain about three-quarters of a mile wide and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
the slope to the creek, with no cover or protection. General
Pender and his brave North Carolinians swept over the plain
and down the bottom under a murderous fire of artillery and
musketry to the brink of the creek; nothing could live under
that fire. The line wavered and staggered back. Mr. Davis,
who was on the field, seeing the charge and the terrible
repulse, ordered General D. H. Hill to send one of his brigades
to his assistance, and Ripley was sent. About dark,
Pender's lines having been reformed and joined by Ripley, a
second advance was made. Though General Pender and his
brave Carolinians knew what was before them, and had seen
with their eyes that the position could not be carried, yet
they went forward with a yell, many to their deaths, and many
more to suffer from their bloody wounds and broken limbs.
There was no chance for Pender to show his skill here, it was
simply a forlorn undertaking. He obeyed orders. General
D. H. Hill, in his article, "Lee's Attack North of the Chickahominy,"
in <cite>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</cite>, writing
of Pender's attack on Beaver Dam, uses the following language:
"The result was as might have been foreseen, a bloody
and disastrous repulse. None of us knew of the formidable
character of the works on Beaver Dam. Our engineers
seemed to know little of the country and nothing of the fortifications
on the creek. The maps furnished the division
commanders were worthless. The lack of knowledge of the
topography was inexcusable. They had plenty of time. The
Federals had been preparing for the movement all the winter,
and McClellan's movements up the Peninsula indicated what
position he would take up. The blood shed by the Southern
troops was wasted in vain. They could have been halted at
Mechanicsville until Jackson had turned the works on the
creek, and all that waste of blood could have been avoided.
Ripley's Brigade was sent by me to the assistance of Pender by
the direct order of both Mr. Davis and General Lee. The
attack on the Beaver Dam entrenchments or the heights of
Malvern Hill and Gettysburg were all grand, but of exactly
the kind of grandeur the South could not afford."</p>

<p>The next morning only a line of skirmishers occupied the
works on Beaver Dam, the scene of yesterday's slaughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
the main line, upon discovering Jackson's near presence on
the night of the 26th, having retreated to another strongly
entrenched position extending from Gaines's Mill to near
Cold Harbor. The Confederates followed, Pender hugging
the Chickahominy, and then turning off by the mill to one-half
mile beyond Cold Harbor. Here Porter's Corps, being
well entrenched and supported by two other divisions sent
to his assistance, made one of the finest battles of the war,
repulsing the Confederates many times, holding Longstreet
and the two Hills and Jackson at bay until about night,
when the lines were broken. A. P. Hill's Corps was the first
to attack. General Pender and his brave soldiers did their
full part there on that day, forgetting their terrible experience
of the day before. He was also at Frazier's Farm&mdash;Glendale&mdash;on
the 30th.</p>

<p>From Beaver Dam to Malvern Hill, inclusive, these battles
were one continuous series of Confederate assaults upon entrenched
Union positions with unparalleled slaughter of the
attacking columns. The Southerners lost, in killed and
wounded, nearly twenty thousand men, the Federals not
much more than half that number. General Longstreet, in
<cite>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</cite>, writes: "General
Lee's plans in the seven days' fight were excellent, but very
poorly executed." General E. P. Alexander, Chief of Artillery
of Longstreet's Corps, in an article in the <cite>Southern
Historical Society Papers</cite> on the battle of Frazier's Farm,
writes: "As no one can go through the details of this action
without surprise at the fatal want of concert of action which
characterized the many gallant and bloody assaults of the Confederates,
it is best to say beforehand that it was but the persistent
mishap of every offensive battlefield which the army
of Northern Virginia ever fought, and that its causes were
not peculiar to any one."</p>

<p>General Pender in his official report of these battles, while
paying full tribute to the memory of the dead, did not fail
to confer honor on the meritorious survivors. He says of
one of our townsmen, now a distinguished lawyer, "Lieutenant
Hinsdale, my acting Assistant Adjutant-General, deserves
the highest praise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee's shattered brigades, somewhat gotten together after
the fights around Richmond, commenced the Maryland campaign.
It was begun to get rid of McClellan around Richmond,
and also to strike General Pope, who was advancing
from Washington with another army by way of Culpeper,
before he and McClellan could unite.</p>

<p>Jackson moved off first, and finding the enemy at Cedar
Run, or Slaughter Station, on the Rapidan, he attacked at
once. He had his hands full, and for a time the battle
seemed to be lost. At the supreme moment Pender came on
the scene, and, by a beautiful flank movement, skillfully and
energetically made, reanimated the wavering Confederate
line, and in a general advance the enemy was beaten off the
field. General Pender, in his official report of this battle,
makes mention of a young soldier, then serving with him,
who is now the accomplished editor of the <cite>News and Observer</cite>,
in terms most complimentary: "Captain Ashe, my Assistant
Adjutant-General, deserves notice for his conduct, being found
almost at every point almost at the same time, cheering on
the men."</p>

<p>At second Manassas, a few days afterwards, Jackson's
Corps received every attack of nearly the whole of the Federal
army without yielding. The fire was delivered very
often during that day at not more than ten paces. There
General Pender was like Ney. The all-importance of holding
the line until Longstreet should arrive was appreciated
by him. He exposed himself here almost recklessly. At Ox
Hill, or Chantilly, where General Phil. Kearney was killed,
General Pender again led the movement. He was wounded
here again. On these fields his superior generalship was
conspicuously displayed. From these battles his reputation
was established as a skillful leader. At Winchester, Harper's
Ferry, and Sharpsburg he was a commanding figure,
always in place, with his troops well in hand on the march
and in battle. His superiors in rank in every movement confided
in his skill as well as in his courage.</p>

<p>The battle of Fredericksburg ended the campaign of 1862.
In this battle General Pender received the highest encomiums
for the steady and cool bravery with which he held his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
brigade under a protracted fire from artillery, the most deadly
of the war. It was a great triumph of discipline, skill, and
valor. He was again wounded here.</p>

<p>General Longstreet spent the winter of 1862-'63 with two
divisions of his corps at and near Suffolk, Virginia, procuring
supplies in eastern North Carolina. Before he returned
to General Lee at Fredericksburg, Hooker, who was in charge
of the Army of the Potomac, more than one hundred and
twenty thousand strong, crossed the Rapidan and took position
on Lee's left flank near Chancellorsville. The Confederate
army numbered about fifty-five thousand of all arms.
Instead of promptly pressing his advantage, Hooker delayed,
and Lee and Jackson acted. This battle was perfect in both
strategy and tactics, and advanced Generals Lee and Jackson
to the forefront of military commanders. The Confederate
soldiers could not add to their laurels already won. In this
battle of Chancellorsville General Pender and his brigade
made a name which will last as long as the fame of the battle
itself. All of us are familiar with the first day's battle.
Howard's Corps was routed by D. H. Hill's old division, commanded
by General Rodes. The tangled growth of the wilderness
and the darkness necessarily threw into great confusion
the Confederate troops which had made the attack.
While they were being reformed and reduced to order, and
some of the brigades relieved by fresh men, the enemy, with
great numbers, who had not been engaged, arrived, and, placing
their artillery at short range, opened fire with fatal effect.
Everything which had been gained seemed to be lost; and,
when it was thought that the Confederate line could not be
held, General Jackson, after he had received his death wound,
recognizing in the darkness General Pender, who had relieved
one of Rodes' brigades, said to him: "You must hold
your ground, General Pender, you must hold your ground,
sir!" and he held his ground. This was General Jackson's
last command.</p>

<p>On the next morning early the handful of Confederates
saw three times their numbers in a wilderness country, thoroughly
entrenched, waiting to receive their attack. The
assault <em>had</em> to be made. Sedgwick, with his corps, was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
rear and flank at Fredericksburg, opposed by Early, who was
too weak to cope with him, and Hooker's main force was between
Lee and Richmond. It was a terrible day&mdash;that Sunday,
the 3d of May, 1863. General Heth, in his official
report of the battle, says that Pender and Thomas, the left of
A. P. Hill's Division, opened the battle. They were repulsed
in the first assault with great loss, but in the second charge
they carried the day. Pender won more glory in this charge
than any other of the heroic souls who took part in it.</p>

<p>General Lee, in his official report of this battle, said:
"General Pender led his brigade to the attack under a destructive
fire, bearing the colors of a regiment in his own
hands up to and over the entrenchments with the most distinguished
gallantry."</p>

<p>After the wounding of General A. P. Hill on that day,
General Pender was put in command of that officer's division
and was wounded late that afternoon. His own official
report of this action proves the modesty and magnanimity
of his great and lofty nature. He said: "I can truly say
that my brigade fought May 3d with unsurpassed courage
and determination. I never knew them to act universally
so well. I noticed no skulking, and they never showed any
hesitation in following their colors. My list in killed and
wounded will show how manfully they fought on that glorious
day. After having witnessed the fighting of nearly all
the troops that fought on the left of the road, I am satisfied
with my own, but by no means claim any superiority. All
that I saw behaved as heroes."</p>

<p>No wonder everybody loved and admired General Pender!</p>

<p>The greatness of General Lee as a commander of armies
is nowhere more certainly seen than in the reorganization
and enlargement of his army after the battles of Chancellorsville.
Within a month after those battles he had organized
the most effective and best disciplined army he ever
had. Longstreet had returned, other reenforcements had
arrived, and when the movement of his army towards the
North was begun, on June 3, 1863, he probably had seventy-five
thousand of all arms. In the reorganization of the
army A. P. Hill had been decided on as a corps commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
and a major-general to command his division was wanted.
On the 20th of May, two weeks after Chancellorsville, General
Lee wrote to Mr. Davis: "If A. P. Hill is promoted a
major-general will be wanted for his division. Pender is
an excellent officer, attentive, industrious, and brave; has
been conspicuous in every battle, and, I believe, wounded in
almost all of them." For a division commander of A. P.
Hill's celebrated "Light Division," no two, or three, or more,
are recommended for the President to choose from, but one,
and that one W. D. Pender. He was appointed Major-General
on the 27th May, 1863, and assigned to that division
composed of the brigades of Scales, Lane, Thomas, and
McGowan, one week later. He was the youngest major-general
in the Confederate army, being only twenty-nine
years old.</p>

<p>Longstreet and Ewell left their camps during the first
week in June, and arrived with Stuart and all the cavalry
at Culpeper on the 8th. Ewell pushed on, and A. P. Hill,
leaving Fredericksburg on the 13th, where the Federals had
remained up to this time, passed Longstreet and moved on
to the Valley of Virginia, Longstreet protecting Hill's flank
by moving himself along the eastern base of the Blue Ridge,
with Stuart and his whole cavalry force in his front to watch
the enemy.</p>

<p>"General Stuart was left to observe the movements of the
enemy, and to impede him as much as possible, should he
attempt to cross the Potomac. In that event, he was directed
to move into Maryland, on right of our column as it advanced."
(General Lee's report.) He, claiming the discretion,
went off on a raid toward Washington, and thereby the
enemy was enabled to interpose himself between the Confederate
infantry and cavalry. Ewell, with his corps, advanced
as far as Carlisle, and Longstreet and Hill were at Chambersburg
on the 27th June. General Lee, in his official report of
the Pennsylvania campaign, says: "It was expected that as
soon as the Federal army should cross the Potomac General
Stuart would give notice of its movements, and nothing having
been heard from him since our entrance into Maryland, it
was inferred that the enemy had not yet left Virginia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
Orders were therefore issued (June 27th) to move on Harrisburg.</p>

<p>"On the night of the 28th news came through a scout that
the Federal army had crossed the Potomac and the head of
the column was at South Mountain, and this arrested the
movement to Harrisburg."</p>

<p>This advance of the enemy threatened General Lee's communications
with Virginia, and he determined to concentrate
his army on the east of the mountains. On the 29th Hill
was ordered to Gettysburg, and Longstreet was to follow
next day. Ewell was ordered to Cashtown or Gettysburg,
as circumstances might require. These movements towards
Gettysburg were not so quickly made as they would have
been had the movements of the enemy been known. Pettigrew's
Brigade went to Gettysburg on the morning of the
30th to get provision, but finding it in the possession of the
Federals, returned to Cashtown, where he rejoined Heth's
and united with Pender's Division. Next morning the divisions
of Pender and Heth and two battalions of artillery advanced
to ascertain the strength of the enemy. Heth, in the
lead, found the enemy's videttes three miles from the town,
they having advanced on the Chambersburg road; he drove
them, but was in turn driven back by a superior force.
Pender coming up at this time, the two divisions advanced and
engaged the enemy. Rodes arrived afterwards, about 2:30
<small>P. M.</small>, on the Middleburg road, formed on Pender's left, at
right angles, and Early coming up on the Heidlersburg road,
formed quickly on Rodes' left, when a general advance was
made, and the enemy gave way everywhere. The success
was complete. Of General Pender's part in this battle another
extract from the letter of General Lewis will be used:
"While we were being placed in line on a hill to join on
Pender's left, his division drove the enemy from the woods
on Seminary Ridge and across the open field about one-third
of a mile wide and three-quarters long. The enemy then
reformed behind Seminary Ridge and, with unlimited artillery,
made a gallant stand, but Pender's 'Light Division,'
with unbroken ranks, drove them from this strong position
just as we advanced to his assistance. General Pender deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
the entire credit of the victory of the battle of the first
day at Gettysburg."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 2d of July Longstreet, with his
corps, except Pickett, who had not arrived, was on the Confederate
right, with the Federals on Round Top and the
adjacent hills in front; Ewell with his corps in front of Culp's
Hill and the north front of Cemetery Hill, and A. P. Hill
in the center, along the western front of Cemetery Hill.
Anderson's Division was the right of Hill's line, Pender's
the left, and Heth's a little in rear, in reserve. At about 5
o'clock in the afternoon Longstreet attacked the Federal left
on Round Top. Hill and Ewell were ordered to make feints
to prevent Federal troops from being withdrawn from their
fronts to reinforce the left, but to attack, if opportunity
offered. It was during this attack of Longstreet that General
Pender received the wound which resulted in his death.
Anderson's Division was ordered in to support Longstreet.
Just before the advance was begun, General Pender and his
Adjutant-General, Major Joseph A. Engelhard, and General
W. G. Lewis, who was then Lieutenant-Colonel of the Forty-third
North Carolina Regiment, were on the extreme left of
Pender's line, engaged in a friendly talk, sitting on a large
granite boulder, when suddenly the enemy's artillery opened
upon our right. Immediately General Pender turned to
Major Engelhard, and said: "Major, this indicates an assault,
and we will ride down our line."</p>

<p>In Major Engelhard's official report of this we find this
account: "Late in the afternoon, during the attack of Longstreet
and a part of Anderson's Division, General Pender
having ridden to the extreme right to advance his division,
did the opportunity occur, received a severe wound in the leg
from a fragment of a shell."</p>

<p>A little later, on this same afternoon, at another part of
the field where Colonel I. E. Avery (brother of Justice A. C.
Avery of our Supreme Court), led the brigade of that distinguished
soldier, General R. F. Hoke, who was absent on
account of a wound received at Fredericksburg, could be
seen the Sixth North Carolina (Pender's old regiment),
under the command of Colonel Tate, now State Treasurer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
climbing the east front of Cemetery Hill under a furious
storm of shot and shell. The hill and its fortifications were
taken, and the proud flag of the old regiment floated above
the captured works, but the brave and gifted Avery yielded
here his soul to God and his life to his country. In a plain
plank box this hero was placed by old Elijah, his colored servant,
and by him brought along with the army on its retreat
from the place where he fell, in a wagon as plain as the
coffin. The old man was seen every day on that long, weary
march, enduring and suffering, but still devoted in his pious
attentions; and his labors ended only when he had delivered
his precious burden to the tender care of loved ones near the
banks of the Potomac.</p>

<p>On the retreat of the Confederates from Gettysburg, General
Pender took ambulance and set out for Staunton, the
nearest railroad connection. Upon reaching that place a
hemorrhage from his wound of an alarming character
occurred. It was stayed, improvement followed, and the
hopes of his friends were reassured; but in a few days, the
hemorrhage recurring, the surgeons determined to amputate
the limb. The operation was performed on the 18th of July.
He survived it only a few hours. Just before the operation
he said to his brother: "Tell my wife that I do not fear to
die. I can confidently resign my soul to God, trusting in
the atonement of our Lord Jesus Christ. My only regret is
to leave her and our children. I have always tried to do my
duty in every sphere of life in which Providence has placed
me."</p>

<p>The body was taken to Tarboro, North Carolina, and
buried in the beautiful grounds around Calvary church. He
was a member of the Episcopal communion, having been
received as a comunicant by confirmation at the hands of
Bishop Johns, in St. John's Church, Richmond, Va., he having
ridden quietly into the city at night for that purpose.</p>

<p>His death was a great public calamity. He combined every
quality of the ideal soldier: courage, the power to control men,
quickness of perception, readiness of decision, strong sense
of justice, and modesty that excelled all. With the exception
of his great commander he had no superior in the Army
of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>In the letter of General Lewis, heretofore referred to,
occurs this sentence: "It was reported, and firmly believed
throughout the Army of Northern Virginia, that General Lee
had said that General Pender was the only officer in his army
that could fill the place of Stonewall Jackson."</p>

<p>Whether General Lee ever expressed himself in this language
may not be proved, yet it is superlative praise to have
the Army of Northern Virginia believe it to be so, and
to hand it down as a tradition. As some proof of this alleged
declaration of General Lee, it will be appropriate to introduce
some testimony from General G. C. Wharton. It is in
the shape of an extract from a letter written from Radford,
Va., on September 5, 1893, to James M. Norfleet, Esq., of
Tarboro: "General Lee was preparing and about giving orders
for the removal of the Army of Northern Virginia from the
Valley of the Shenandoah (between Winchester and the Potomac)
to the vicinity of Orange Court House. As my command
was in good condition, not having been in the forced
marches, nor in the battle of Gettysburg, General Lee decided
to leave my command, with some cavalry, temporarily to protect
his rear until his main force should cross the Blue Ridge
at Manassas and other gaps and be well on the march to the
Rapidan Valley. My orders were that after the army had
crossed the Blue Ridge, unless too much pressed by the enemy,
I was to retire slowly up the Shenandoah Valley, cross the
Blue Ridge at Brown's or Williams' Gap, and rejoin the army
(via Madison Court House) at or near Orange Court House.
After explaining his wishes and giving the necessary orders, I
was about leaving General Lee's headquarters, when General
A. P. Hill, an old friend and schoolmate, rode up. After the
usual salutations, we entered into a general conversation in
regard to the movement of the troops and the result of the
recent campaign in Maryland and Pennsylvania, specially in
regard to the ill-fated battle of Gettysburg. In the course of
conversation, General Lee said, with sadness: 'I ought not to
have fought the battle at Gettysburg; it was a mistake.' Then,
after a short hesitation, he added: 'But the stakes were so
great I was compelled to play; for had we succeeded Harrisburg,
Baltimore, and Washington were in our hands; and,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
(with emphasis) 'we would have succeeded had Pender
lived.'" In General Lee's first report, 30th of July, 1863, of
the battle of Gettysburg, he refers at length to the services of
General Pender and his death, and in terms of higher praise
than can be found, after diligent search amongst his official
reports of battles, than he used concerning any of his fallen
subordinates except General Jackson. In this report he says:
"General Pender has since died. This lamented officer has
borne a distinguished part in every engagement of this
army, and was wounded on several occasions while leading
his command with conspicuous gallantry and ability. The
confidence and admiration inspired by his courage and capacity
as an officer were only equaled by the esteem and respect entertained
by all with whom he was associated for the noble
qualities of his modest and unassuming character."</p>

<p>General A. P. Hill, in his official report of the battle of the
second day, says: "On this day, also, the Confederacy lost
the invaluable services of Major-General W. D. Pender,
wounded by a shell, and since dead. No man fell during this
bloody battle of Gettysburg more regretted than he, nor
around whose youthful brow were clustered brighter rays of
glory."</p>

<p>General Pender undoubtedly made a great and lasting
impression on General Lee. Six months after his first report
of the battle of Gettysburg he made a full and complete one.
Of course he thought well of what was to be his final report
of this battle. In it he expressed himself in language concerning
General Pender more complimentary, if possible,
than that used in his first report. Here it is: "The loss of
Major-General Pender is severely felt by the army and the
country. He served with this army from the beginning of
the war, and took a distinguished part in all its engagements.
Wounded on several occasions, he never left his command
in action until he received the injury that resulted in his
death. His promise and usefulness as an officer were only
equaled by the purity and excellence of his private life."</p>

<p>There is no need for further panegyric.</p>

<p>General Pender did not think his wound a mortal one
when he received it, nor did his friends. His commissary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
Major D. T. Carraway, saw him in the ambulance, and,
though suffering from the wound, he particularly inquired
about the quantity of commissary supplies on hand, and
about the condition and comfort of his soldiers as minutely
as when he was well. He knew, though, that his wound was
a serious one, and would be long in healing; he therefore
turned his face from the field of carnage and was driven
towards the South.</p>

<p>Ah! we know where his thoughts were then. Though as
brave as the lion, he was yet as gentle as the lamb. He had
often heard the wild shouts of his fierce soldiery as he led
them, with colors in his own hands, over fields red with
slaughter, and he had also, in the beautiful summer days
gone by, romped and played with his little children over
field and meadow and in grassy lawn, while the wife and
mother looked on with beaming face. But now, sorely
wounded and helpless, his heart turned toward her, toward
her who was more precious to him than fame, and battle, and
glory.</p>

<p>"God bless all good women&mdash;to their soft hands and pitying
hearts we must all come at last."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Judge Montgomery has portrayed the character of one of
the ablest soldiers and most attractive men that the Civil War
developed. It is well that this duty fell on him to whom it
was a labor of love, who appreciated the value of Pender's
life, and depended upon facts rather than rhetoric to fix his
place in history and in the hearts of his grateful countrymen.</p>

<p>The remarks on the difficulties under which the South
labored, appropriate in his Memorial Address, delivered May
10, 1894 (of which the foregoing sketch forms the main
part), and well considered in themselves, are not essential to
the sketch here presented, and are therefore omitted.</p>

<small>BY WM. R. COX</small>.</h2>


<p>Stephen Dodson Ramseur, the second child of Jacob A. and
Lucy M. Ramseur, had Revolutionary blood in his veins
through John Wilfong, a hero who was wounded at King's
Mountain and fought at Eutaw Springs. He was born in
Lincolnton the 31st day of May, 1837. His surroundings
were well calculated to promote a well developed character
and a strong, self-relying manhood. His parents were members
of the Presbyterian Church and did not neglect to see
their son properly instructed in its religious tenets. They
were possessed of ample means for their section, and gave to
him the best advantages of social and intellectual improvement
without his being exposed to the "devices and snares of
the outer world." To the strong and beautiful character of his
mother, Ramseur is said to have been indebted for the greater
part of his success in life. In preparing the life of Dr.
Thornwell, Rev. Dr. Palmer has asserted a truth which may
be classed as a proverb: "The pages of history will be searched
in vain for a great man who had a fool for his mother." In
writing of her, the Hon. David Schenck, who married Sallie
Wilfong, her second daughter, says: "As a young lady she
was said to have been beautiful and attractive. I knew
her intimately from 1849 to her death. She was a
woman of great force of character. To a judgment clear and
firm she united gentleness, tenderness and sympathy. Her
manners were easy and courteous and fascinating. She was
an active and devoted member of the Presbyterian Church,
and brought up her children in the teachings of the shorter
catechism from their early youth. It was to her that General
Ramseur owed the mental and moral foundations of his
character." He received his preparatory training in the
schools of Lincolnton and Milton; thence he matriculated at
Davidson College, entered the freshman class and passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
eighteen months at this institution. He early displayed that
decision of character and force of will which distinguished
him in after life. He had an ardent longing for a military
career, and though disappointed in his efforts to secure an
appointment as a cadet at the United States Military Academy,
he was not cast down. Through the aid of General D.
H. Hill, then a professor at Davidson, his second application
was successful. He was given his appointment to the Academy
by that sturdy old Roman, Hon. Burton Craige, who
before the days of rotation in office was long an able and distinguished
member of Congress from our State. Ramseur
spent the usual term of five years at the Academy and was
graduated with distinction in the class of 1860. Among his
classmates of national reputation were General James H. Wilson
and General Merritt, Colonel Wilson, Commandant at
United States Military Academy, and Colonel A. C. M.
Pennington.</p>

<p>Through his courtesy, sincerity and conscientious discharge
of his duties while at West Point he formed many valued
friendships both among his fellow-students and in the corps.
After graduating, Ramseur entered the light artillery service
and was commissioned Second Lieutenant by brevet. He was
in the United States army but a short time prior to the breaking
out of hostilities, and during that time was assigned to
duty at Fortress Monroe. In April, 1861, he resigned his commission
in the old army and promptly tendered his sword to
the Provisional Government of the Confederate States, then
assembled at Montgomery. By this government he was commissioned
First Lieutenant of Artillery and ordered to the department
of Mississippi. About this time a battery of artillery
was being formed at Raleigh, whose membership was composed
of the flower of the patriotic youth of the State. It was
called "the Ellis Artillery," in honor of our then very able
and patriotic Governor, whose early death from phthisis was
an irreparable loss to our State in the early days of the war.
The officers were Manly, Saunders, Guion and Bridgers, who,
owing to our long peace establishment, were not familiar with
even the rudiments of the drill. Therefore, with more patriotism
than selfish emulation, they promptly applied through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Lieutenant Saunders to their friend the Governor for some
suitable and reliable commander. With a pardonable pride
in so fine a company, Governor Ellis had doubtless previously
considered this subject in his own mind. At all events, so
soon as the request was made known he promptly replied:
"I have the very man. You couldn't get a better. It is
Lieutenant Ramseur." Thereupon a dispatch was sent tendering
him the command, which reached him on his way to
his new field of duty. He accepted the unsolicited, but none
the less coveted distinction of repelling the invasion of his
native State in command of her own sons, and repaired at once
to Raleigh. On arriving at the camp of instruction near this
place, he found a first-class command of raw recruits without
equipments or discipline or the remotest conception of the
magnitude of the great contest before them. Many had
joined the artillery because it was known to be one of the
higher and more attractive branches of the service. They
concurred with Secretary Seward, that the war was a matter
of a few months, or else with Vice-President Stephens, that
for the defense of their firesides gentlemen should not be kept
in camps of instruction and discipline, but permitted to
remain at their homes, for they were capable of judging when
the enemy should be met, and by what methods most easily
defeated. If they had read of war, it was in books which
gave it such gloss and glamour as made every battle magnificent,
if not positively delectable, for such, indeed, is the general
current of popular history. Not so Ramseur, who had
been taught in the school where the art of war is thoroughly
explained, the discipline and drudgery of soldier life daily
seen, and the distinctions and advantages of rank recognized
and respected. His education and experience led him to
concur with Viscount Woolsey, who, in speaking of war, declares
that active service teaches us some painful lessons:
"That all men are not heroes; that the quality as well as quantity
of their courage differs largely; that some men are positively
cowards; that there always is, always has been, and
always will be, a good deal of skulking and malingering; it
teaches us not to expect too much from any body of men;
above all things to value the truly brave men as worth more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
than all the talkers and spouters who have ever squabbled for
place in the arena of politics." Ramseur was well satisfied
with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of his command, and resolved to employ
it to the best advantage. To do this his men must have a
knowledge of tactics and discipline; and subordination was indispensable.
He had considered all this, and determined what
was right; and whether it consorted with the wishes and
inclinations of those who belonged to the command or not
was not material with him. Indeed, duty was his polar star.
He did not willingly sever his connection from the old army,
but when called on to elect whether he would fight for or
against his people and his State, there was no hesitancy, no
doubt as to where his duty lay; he threw his whole soul and
energies into the cause of the South. This company was composed
of twelve-months men. Ramseur wanted soldiers, and
wanted them for the war. This being known, a few members
of the company began to become discontented. They feared
they were to be treated as regular soldiers, and insisted that,
inasmuch as they had volunteered only for twelve months,
should the company be reorganized for the war, they were entitled
to withdraw. They were good men and did not desire
to leave the service; they were allowed to withdraw, and in
other fields made valiant soldiers. The reorganization of the
battery was soon completed, all elements of discord eliminated,
and, under the skillful management and discipline of its new
captain it made admirable progress. The great thing now
was to secure its guns and equipments, and in this the company
was aided by its name and the patriotic ardor of the citizens
of Raleigh. At this time there was only one field battery
available, and for it another company was applying. The
name and <em>personnel</em> of the Ellis Artillery won the prize, while
the voluntary subscriptions of our citizens supplied it with
horses. Being without tents or suitable parade grounds, Mr.
William Boylan tendered it his residence and out-buildings
for shelter and ample grounds as a camp for instruction. The
offer was accepted, and here the company received that impress
which, when called to Virginia and brought in comparison
with others, carried off the palm for their soldierly
bearing, their splendid drill and handsome equipment. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the latter part of the summer of 1861 the company was
ordered to Smithfield, Va., where the fall and winter months
were spent without graver duties than occasional reconnoissances
to and from Norfolk. McClellan's army was now
near Washington, confronted by that of General Joe Johnston,
while the public mind of the North was becoming very
impatient at its inaction, and began to renew the cry "On to
Richmond!" which had been so popular before the inglorious
defeat of the Federal army at Manassas. McClellan, unable
to resist this clamor, determined to endeavor to reach the Confederate
capital by way of the lower Chesapeake, transferred
his army on transports to the Peninsula and sat down before
Yorktown. It is estimated that McClellan at this time
had an army of not less than one hundred and twenty thousand
men fit for duty. This force was to be confronted and
delayed&mdash;until Johnston could arrive&mdash;by thirteen thousand
Confederates under J. B. Magruder, who, in order to accomplish
this purpose, was compelled to cover a front of thirteen
miles with his small force. The work was done with consummate
ability, and it is no disparagement to others to say there
was no officer in either army better qualified to play such a
game of bluff than the genial, whole-souled Magruder. Ramseur
was ordered to report with his battery at Yorktown.
When he arrived Magruder, who had known him in the old
army, detached him from his battery and placed him in command
of all the artillery on his right. Here Ramseur saw his
first active service in the field, and received the promotion of
major. On the arrival of the forces of McClellan a campaign
of maneuvering commenced which delayed advance for over
a month. In the meantime Ramseur had been elected Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Third Regiment of Volunteers, but declined
to leave his battery. Subsequently, and before serious
demonstrations had begun, he was elected Colonel of the
Forty-ninth Regiment of Infantry. He was still reluctant to
leave his battery, but appreciating the fact that Manly and
its other officers were then well qualified for any duties that
might be required of them, through the persuasion of friends
he was induced to accept the promotion. Subsequent events
soon justified his confidence in this artillery company. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
battle of Williamsburg, where it received its first baptism of
fire, it gathered fadeless laurels which it was destined to wear
throughout the war with a fame still augmenting.</p>

<p>The Forty-ninth Regiment was composed of raw recruits
who were gathered together in the camp of instruction at
Raleigh, organized into companies and regiments and instructed
as to its duties in the field. With his accustomed
energy and ability Ramseur immediately addressed himself to
the labor of making soldiers out of these new recruits. By
constant drill he soon had his regiment in fair condition; and,
as the emergency was pressing, he moved with it to the point
of danger. The regiment was assigned to the brigade of an
old army officer, General Robert Ransom, who was soon to
become a distinguished major-general of cavalry in the Army
of Northern Virginia, and thence to be assigned to the command
of all the cavalry under Longstreet in his operations in
the West. In the series of battles around Richmond, known
as the "Seven Days' Fight," Ramseur, while gallantly leading
his regiment in the battle of Malvern Hill, received a
severe and disabling wound through the right arm, but declined
to leave the field until the action was over. This
wound necessitated his removal to Richmond, where he was
detained for over a month before his injury permitted him to
enjoy the much-coveted pleasure of a visit to his home. Indeed,
the arm was broken, and he was ever afterwards compelled
to wear it in a sling.</p>

<p>In his report General Ransom speaks of the conspicuous
gallantry of Ramseur and his men, and it was by reason of his
soldierly qualities mainly, displayed upon this occasion, that
his promotion to the rank of brigadier-general soon followed.
While still at home wounded Ramseur received notice of his
unexpected promotion. At first he doubted whether one so
young should accept so responsible a position, and was disposed
to decline the promotion. His friends did not coincide
in his views, and through their persuasion he was induced to
accept it. In October, 1862, with his arm still disabled, he
went to Richmond to make a decision in regard to the brigade
offered him. While there he called upon Mr. Davis, alike distinguished
as a soldier and a statesman, to whom he expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the fears then agitating his mind. In that affable and engaging
manner peculiar to himself, Mr. Davis at once dismissed
any suggestion of his declining, and on the contrary urged
him to accept the command, return home and remain until
he had entirely recovered his health and his strength. But
Ramseur obeyed only in part the suggestions of his commander-in-chief.
He accepted the command of the brigade
and went at once to the Army of Northern Virginia, and, with
his wound still green, entered upon the discharge of his duties.
This brigade was then composed of the Second Regiment, organized
and instructed by that able tactician, scholarly and
accomplished gentleman, Colonel C. C. Tew, who was killed
at Sharpsburg; the Fourth by the chivalrous and lamented
Brigadier-General George B. Anderson, who died of wounds
received at Sharpsburg; the Fourteenth, before its reorganization,
was commanded and instructed by that soldierly and
ardent North Carolinian, Brigadier-General Junius Daniel,
who fell in the Spottsylvania campaign ere his commission as
a major-general had reached him; and the Thirtieth by
Colonel F. M. Parker, the brave soldier and courteous gentleman,
of whom further mention will be made during the
course of this narrative. Ramseur was fitly chosen the commander
of this distinguished brigade, and immediately addressed
himself to its reorganization. His admirable qualifications
for his duties and his pure and chivalrous character
were soon recognized and appreciated, and infused new life
and spirit into the command. As a disciplinarian he was
rigid; as a tactician, skillful; as a judge of men, good; as a
redresser of wrongs, prompt; as an officer, courteous and
urbane; as a soldier, fearless and chivalrous. He early commanded
the respect and ultimately won the hearts of all over
whom he held command. This brigade at the time he took
it was in Rodes' Division of Jackson's Corps. Ramseur remained
in command without events of any particular importance
occurring until he entered upon his Chancellorsville campaign.
His report of that famous battle is so full and
complete, and so clearly displays his unselfish and chivalrous
nature, that I am confident I cannot do better than to incorporate
it as a part of this sketch. It reads as follows:</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">May</span> 23, 1863.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir:</span>&mdash;In obedience to Order No. &mdash;, dated May 7th,
1863, I have the honor to submit the following report of the
operations of my brigade in the series of skirmishes and battles
opening at Massaponax Creek and ending in the splendid victory
at Chancellorsville:</p>

<p>"Wednesday, <small>A. M.</small>, April 29th, the brigade was placed
below Massaponax Creek to dispute the enemy's crossing, and
remained in that position, occasionally annoyed by their artillery
(by which I lost a few men) and kept on the alert by
picket firing until Thursday evening, when we were withdrawn
to a point near Hamilton's Crossing.</p>

<p>"Friday, May 1st, at 3 <small>A. M.</small>, we were aroused for the
march and led the advance of Major-General Rodes' Division
in the direction of Chancellorsville. At a distance of seven
miles from Fredericksburg we were detached from our own
division and ordered to report to Major-General Anderson,
when we advanced upon the enemy, who fell back in confusion
before our sharpshooters for several miles, strewing the
way with their arms and baggage, this brigade, with General
Posey on our right and General Wright on our left, for upwards
perhaps of two miles, being in advance. About 6
<small>P. M.</small> we found the foe in force upon our front and supported
by batteries that poured grape unsparingly into the
woods through which we were still advancing. Night approaching,
a halt was ordered, and we slept on our arms with
a strong picket line on the outposts.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 2d, we were relieved about sunrise and
shortly thereafter marched by a series of circuitous routes and
with surpassing strategy to a position in the rear of the enemy,
whom at about 5 <small>P. M.</small> we were ordered to attack.</p>

<p>"This brigade was directed to support Brigadier-General
Colquitt, with orders to overlap his right by one regiment, and
was placed accordingly. At the command we advanced with
the division, preserving a distance of about one hundred yards
in the rear of General Colquitt. Brisk firing was soon heard
upon our front and left, indicating that General Doles had
encountered the foe. At this point General Colquitt moved
by the right flank, sending me word by an officer of his staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
that the enemy was attempting to turn his right. I immediately
moved by the right flank, but heard no firing in that
quarter. Again he sent his staff officer to inform me that
the enemy was passing by his right flank, when I directed him
to say to General Colquitt (in effect) that the firing indicated
a sharp fight with General Doles, and that my impression was
that his support was needed there, and that I would take care
of his right flank. General Colquitt moved to the front, with
the exception of one regiment, which continued to the right.
I then pressed on by the right flank to meet the enemy that
General Colquitt's staff officer twice reported to me to be in
that direction, and prosecuted the search for half a mile perhaps,
but not a solitary Yankee was to be seen. I then came
up to the division line and moved by the left flank to the support
of General Colquitt, whose men were resting in line of
battle on the field General Doles had won.</p>

<p>"Saturday night our divisions occupied the last line of battle
within the intrenchments from which the routed corps of
Sigel had fled in terror. My brigade was placed perpendicular
to the plank-road, the left resting on the road, General Doles
on my right and Colonel (E. A.) O'Neal, commanding Rodes'
Brigade, on my left. I placed Colonel (F. M.) Parker, Thirtieth
North Carolina, on the right of my brigade; Colonel
(R. T.) Bennett, Fourteenth North Carolina, on right centre;
Colonel (W. R.) Cox, Second North Carolina, left centre,
and Colonel (Bryan) Grimes, Fourth North Carolina, on left.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 3d, the division, being as stated, in the third
line of battle, advanced about 9 o'clock to the support of the
second line. After proceeding about one-fourth of a mile I
was applied to by Major (W. J.) Pegram for support to his
battery, when I detached Colonel Parker, Thirtieth North
Carolina, for this purpose, with orders to advance obliquely
to his front and left and join me after his support should be
no longer needed, or to fight his regiment as circumstances
might require. I continued to advance to the first line of
breastworks, from which the enemy had been driven, and
behind which I found a small portion of Paxton's Brigade
and Jones' Brigade, of Trimble's Division. Knowing that a
general advance had been ordered, I told these troops to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
forward. Not a man moved. I then reported this state of
things to Major-General Stuart, who directed me to assume
command of these troops and compel them to advance. This
I essayed to do, and, after fruitless efforts, ascertained that
General Jones was not on the field and that Colonel (T. S.)
Garnett had been killed, I reported again to General Stuart,
who was near, and requested permission to run over the
troops in my front, which was cheerfully granted. At the
command 'Forward!' my brigade, with a shout, cleared the
breastworks and charged the enemy. The Fourth North
Carolina (Colonel Grimes) and seven companies of the Second
North Carolina (Colonel Cox) drove the enemy before them
until they had taken the last line of his works, which they
held under a severe, direct, and enfilading fire, repulsing several
assaults on this portion of our front. The Fourteenth
North Carolina (Colonel Bennett) and three companies of the
Second were compelled to halt some one hundred and fifty
or two hundred yards in rear of the troops just mentioned for
the reason that the troops on my right had failed to come up
and the enemy was in heavy force on my right flank. Had
Colonel Bennett advanced the enemy could easily have turned
my right. As it was, my line was subjected to a horrible enfilading
fire, by which I lost severely. I saw the danger
threatening my right, and sent several times to Jones' Brigade
to come to my assistance, and I also went back twice myself
and exhorted and ordered it (officers and men) to fill up the
gap (some five or six hundred yards) on my right, but all in
vain. I then reported to General Rodes that unless support
was sent to drive the enemy from my right I would have to
fall back. In the meantime Colonel Parker of the Thirtieth
North Carolina, approaching from the battery on the right,
suddenly fell upon the flank and repulsed a heavy column of
the enemy who were moving to get in my rear by my right
flank, some three or four hundred of them surrendering to
him as prisoners of war. The enemy still held his strong
position in the ravine on my right, so that the Fourteenth
North Carolina and the three companies of the Second North
Carolina could not advance. The enemy discovered this situation
of affairs and pushed a brigade to the right and rear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
Colonel Grimes and seven companies of Colonel Cox's (Second
North Carolina), with the intention of capturing their
commands. This advance was made under a terrible direct
fire of musketry and artillery. The move necessitated a retrograde
movement on the part of Colonels Grimes and Cox,
which was executed in order, but with the loss of some prisoners,
who did not hear the command to retire. Colonel Bennett
held his position until ordered to fall back, and, in common
with all the others, to replenish his empty cartridge-boxes.
The enemy did not halt at this position, but retired
to his battery, from which he was quickly driven, Colonel
Parker of the Thirtieth North Carolina sweeping over it with
the troops on my right.</p>

<p>"After replenishing cartridge-boxes I received an order
from Major-General Rodes to throw my brigade on the left of
the road to meet an apprehended attack of the enemy in that
quarter. This was done, and afterwards I was moved to a
position on the plank-road which was intrenched, and which
we occupied until the division was ordered back to camp, near
Hamilton's Crossing.</p>

<p>"The charge of the brigade, made at a critical moment,
when the enemy had broken and was hotly pressing the centre
of the line in our front with apparently overwhelming numbers,
not only checked his advance but threw him back in disorder
and pushed him with heavy loss from his last line of
works.</p>

<p>"Too high praise cannot be accredited to officers and men
for their gallantry, fortitude, and manly courage during
this brief but arduous campaign. Exposed as they had been
for five days immediately preceding the fights on the picket
line, they were, of course, somewhat wearied, but the order
to move forward and confront the enemy brightened every
eye and quickened every step. Under fire all through Wednesday,
Wednesday night and Thursday, without being able
effectually to return this fire, they bore all bravely, and led
the march towards Chancellorsville on Friday morning in
splendid order. The advance of the brigade on Friday afternoon
was made under the very eyes of our departed hero
(Jackson) and of Major-General A. P. Hill, whose words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
praise and commendation, bestowed upon the field, we fondly
cherish. And on Sunday the magnificent charge of the brigade
upon the enemy's last and most terrible stronghold was
made in view of Major-General Stuart and our division commander,
Major-General R. E. Rodes, whose testimony that it
was the most glorious charge of that most glorious day we are
proud to remember and report to our kindred and friends.</p>

<p>"To enumerate all the officers and men who deserve special
mention for their gallantry would be to return a list of all
who were on the field. All met the enemy with unflinching
courage; and for privations, hardships, and splendid marches,
all of which were cheerfully borne, they richly deserve the
thanks of our beautiful and glorious Confederacy.</p>

<p>"I cannot close without mentioning the conspicuous gallantry
and great efficiency of my regimental commanders.
Colonel Parker of the Thirtieth North Carolina was detached
during the fight of Sunday to support a battery, and, having
accomplished that object, moved forward on his own responsibility
and greatly contributed to wrest the enemy's stronghold
at Chancellorsville from their grasp as well as prevent
their threatened demonstrations upon the right of my brigade;
the gallant Grimes of the Fourth North Carolina, whose conduct
on other fields gave promise of what was fully realized
on this; Colonel Bennett of the Fourteenth North Carolina,
conspicuous for his coolness under the hottest fire, and last,
though not least, the manly and chivalrous Cox of the Second
North Carolina, the accomplished gentleman, splendid soldier,
and warm friend, who, though wounded five times, remained
with his regiment until exhausted. In common with the
entire command, I regret his temporary absence from the field,
where he loved to be.</p>

<p>"Major Daniel W. Hurtt, Second North Carolina State
Troops, commanded the skirmishers faithfully and well.</p>

<p>"To the field and company officers, one and all, my thanks
are due for the zeal and bravery displayed under the most
trying circumstances.</p>

<p>"To the gentlemen of my staff I owe especial thanks for
services rendered on the march and upon the field. Captain
Seaton Gales, Assistant Adjutant-General, and Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
Caleb Richmond, Aid-de-camp, were with me all the time,
promptly carrying orders under the very hottest fire. I take
pleasure, too, in speaking of the bravery of private James
Stinson, courier, a youth of twenty, who displayed qualities a
veteran might boast of, and of the conduct of private J. B.
Beggarly, also a courier to headquarters.</p>

<p>"To Dr. G. W. Briggs, Senior Surgeon of the brigade, my
thanks are due for his zeal, skill, and care of the wounded.</p>

<p>"I am, sir, very respectfully,</p>

<p class="sig">

<br />
"<span class="smcap">Stephen D. Ramseur</span>,<br />
"<i>Brigadier-General Commanding</i>."<br />
</p>

<p>In the report of this battle by Major-General Rodes he
makes the following remarks as to the part borne by Ramseur's
Brigade: ...</p>

<p>"While these movements were taking place on the left,
Ramseur and Doles pushed forward on the right, passed the
first line of intrenchments, which had already been carried,
passed the first and second lines of our troops, and became
fiercely engaged. Doles deflecting to the right, passed up a
ravine behind the graveyard on Chancellor's Hill, and finally
came out in the field nearly opposite the house, driving the
enemy before him as he advanced, actually getting several
hundred yards to the rear as well of those troops opposing the
rest of my division as of those opposing General Anderson's
Division. Subsequently he was compelled to fall back, and
was directed by General Lee to take a large body of prisoners.
Ramseur, after vainly urging the troops in the first
line of intrenchments to move forward, obtained permission to
pass them, and, dashing over the works, charged the second
intrenchment in the most brilliant style. The struggle at this
point was long and obstinate, but the charge on the left of the
plank-road at this time caused the enemy to give way on his
left, and this, combined with the unflinching determination
of his men, carried the day and gave him possession of the
works. Not being supported, he was exposed still to a galling
fire from the right, with great danger of being flanked. Notwithstanding
repeated efforts made by him, and by myself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
person, none of the troops in his rear would move up until the
old 'Stonewall Brigade' arrived on the ground and gallantly
advanced in conjunction with the Thirtieth North Carolina
Regiment, Colonel F. M. Parker, of Ramseur's Brigade, which
had been detached to support a battery, and was now on its
return. Occupying the works on the right of Ramseur, and
thus relieving him when his ammunition was nearly exhausted,
the Stonewall Brigade pushed on and carried Chancellorsville
heights, making the third time that they were captured."</p>

<p>In this battle Ramseur, though severely wounded, declined
to leave the field, and is especially mentioned by Rodes as one
who was "distinguished for great gallantry and efficiency in
this action."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that it was here that that great ideal
soldier of the Army of Northern Virginia, who stood second
only to Lee, Stonewall Jackson, fell mortally wounded, and
was carried from the field. His command then devolved on
A. P. Hill, who was wounded, and then upon General J. E. B.
Stuart, whose plume, like that of Henry of Navarre, was
always seen conspicuous in the thickest of the affray. While
each of these generals mentioned Ramseur and his brigade in
the most flattering terms, I will not stop to quote from their
reports. I prefer to hasten on and call your attention to what
will be recognized by every soldier of that army as one of the
highest compliments and most distinguished tributes that could
have been paid. I beg you to pause and reflect upon the
force and power of each expression. It emanates from one
not given to compliments, but who, in all his public communications,
seemed to weigh and carefully consider each word. I
am confident that the existence of this letter was not known
either to Ramseur or to any of his command when written,
and came to my notice for the first time only very recently.</p>

<p>It reads as follows:</p>

Ramseur's Brigade. Its ranks have been much thinned by
the casualties of the battles in which it has been engaged, in
all of which it has rendered conspicuous service. I consider
its brigade and regimental commanders as among the best
of their respective grades in the army, and in the battle of
Chancellorsville, where the brigade was much distinguished
and suffered severely, General Ramseur was among those
whose conduct was especially commended to my notice by
Lieutenant-General Jackson in a message sent to me after he
was wounded. I am very desirous that the efficiency of this
brigade should be increased by filling its ranks, and respectfully
ask that, if it be in your power, you will send on recruits
for its various regiments as soon as possible. If this cannot
be done I would recommend that two additional regiments
be sent to it if they can be had. I am satisfied that the men
could be used in no better way to render valuable service to
the country and win credit for themselves and their State.</p>

</p>

<p>After the battle of Chancellorsville, Ramseur, with his brigade,
accompanied the army of Lee in its invasion of Pennsylvania.
In connection with Rodes' Division, in the first
day's fight at Gettysburg, they secured the elevated ridge
known as Oak Hill, which was the key to the entire field.
Swinton, in his <cite>Campaigns of Army of the Potomac</cite>,
says: "When towards three o'clock a general advance was
made by the Confederates, Rodes speedily broke through the
Union centre, carrying away the right of the First Corps and
the left of the Eleventh, and, entering the interval between
them, disrupted the whole line." The Federal troops fell
back in much disorder, and were pursued by our troops
through the town of Gettysburg. This was our opportunity
to have seized the heights, the subsequent assaults on which
proved so disastrous to us during the progress of this battle.
Ramseur urged that the pursuit should be continued until
Cemetery Heights were in our possession. The light of subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
events shows that he was clearly in the right. Our
friends in Virginia are fond of boasting of the advanced position
of their troops at Gettysburg. It is a thing to be boasted
of. Her sons were gallant and martial, and far be it from
me to detract one tittle from the fame to which they are entitled,
yet it is but an act of justice to call attention to the fact
that the only two brigades which entered the works of Cemetery
Heights on the second day of the battle were Hoke's
North Carolina and Hays' Louisiana Brigades. The former
was then under the command of that gallant soldier and
accomplished gentleman, Colonel Isaac E. Avery, who lost his
life on this occasion while gallantly leading his brigade on the
heights on the 2d of July. In his report of this battle,
Early says: ...</p>

<p>"As soon as Johnson became warmly engaged, which was
a little before dusk, I ordered Hays and Avery to advance
and carry the works on the heights in front. These troops
advanced in gallant style to the attack, passing over the ridge
in front of them under a heavy artillery fire, and there crossing
a hollow between that and Cemetery Hill, and moving up
this hill in the face of at least two lines of infantry posted
behind stone and plank fences, and passing over all obstacles,
they reached the crest of the hill and entered the enemy's
breastworks, crossing it, getting possession of one or two batteries."</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Iverson, of Georgia, had manifested such
a want of capacity in the field at Gettysburg that he was
relieved of his command and assigned to provost guard duty.
As a further mark of Lee's appreciation of Ramseur, this brigade
was assigned temporarily to his command, in addition to
the one he already commanded.</p>

<p>In the various skirmishes and battles of this campaign Ramseur
displayed his usual efficiency and gallantry. After returning
from Pennsylvania our troops went into winter quarters
near Orange Court House, and as it was clear that after
the exhaustive campaigns of the year we would enjoy a period
of comparative quiet, Ramseur obtained leave of absence for
the purpose of entering into the most important relations of
one's life. He had long been attached to and was then engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
to Miss Ellen E. Richmond, of Milton, but the consummation
of his hopes had been often deferred by the exigencies
of the public service. He was now made supremely
happy in their marriage, which occurred on the 22d of October,
1863.</p>

<p>The successive failures of the Army of the Potomac in its
engagements with the Army of Northern Virginia created a
general apprehension throughout the North that unless something
more satisfactory was accomplished the successful issue
of the war was becoming a most doubtful problem. This
prompted the nomination of General Grant to the grade of
Lieutenant-General, and he was assigned to the command of
"all the armies of the United States." One of the conditions
of his acceptance was that he should not be hampered in the
discharge of his duties by the central authorities at Washington&mdash;a
wise and judicious precaution, which else had resulted
in his supersedure after his terrible losses at Cold Harbor,
where, according to Swinton, he had thirteen thousand of his
men killed and wounded within the space of two hours, and
this without inflicting but little loss on his adversary.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 5th, 1864, over one hundred thousand
of Grant's troops had crossed the Rapidan, and thence
followed that series of battles on the overland route to Richmond,
wherein the killed, wounded and disabled on the part
of Grant's army were as great as the whole army of Lee when
these engagements commenced. During this march Ramseur's
men were frequently engaged in successful skirmishes
and battles with the enemy, but the great battle in which he
shone conspicuously was on the 12th of May, at Spottsylvania
Court House.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 11th there was severe fighting on
our right, when Ramseur's men mounted our works and
drove the enemy from our front in a hand-to-hand engagement.
It was expected by Lee that during the night Grant
would withdraw his troops for the purpose of continuing his
advance on Richmond. In order to be in readiness to confront
him when he should make this change, Lee had directed
that the guns in front of Ed. Johnson's Division, in a point in
our lines known as the "salient," should be withdrawn during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
the night to facilitate our movements in the morning. This
fact became known to Grant through a deserter from our
lines. Hancock's Corps was in front of this point, and he was
directed to approach under the cover of night and a dense fog
and assault the line at early dawn. The attack resulted most
successfully, for our works were captured, together with a
large number of prisoners. To restore in part this line became
Ramseur's duty. In his report of the action he speaks
substantially as follows: That in anticipation of an attack on
his front on the morning of the 12th he had his brigade under
arms at early dawn. Very soon he heard a terrible assault on
his right. He therefore moved Cox's Regiment, which was
in reserve, to a position perpendicular to his line of battle.
At this time the enemy was massing his troops for a further
advance. For the purpose of driving him back he formed his
brigade in a line parallel to the two lines held by the enemy.
The men in charging were directed to keep their alignment
and not pause until both lines of works were ours. How gallantly
and successfully these orders were executed were witnessed
by Generals Rodes and Ewell. The two lines of Federal
troops were driven pell-mell out and over both lines of
our original works with great loss. The enemy held the
breastworks on our right, enfilading the line with destructive
fire, at the same time heavily assaulting our right front. In
this extremity, Colonel Bennett of the Fourteenth offered to
take his regiment from left to right, under a severe fire, and
drive back the growing masses of the enemy on our right.
This hazardous offer was accepted as a forlorn hope, and was
most successfully executed. To Colonel Bennett, and his men,
and to his gallant officers, says General Ramseur, all honor
is due. I distinctly recall the circumstances under which the
charge was made, and for cool audacity and unflinching courage
I never saw it surpassed. At the time the movement was
commenced Colonel Parker's Regiment and the Federals were
engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter in and over the works,
while my regiment was pouring a most destructive fire into
the Federals in our front. We entered these works at 4 o'clock
on the morning of the 12th and remained in the works fighting
and contending for over twenty hours. When relieved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
hungry and exhausted, we dropped upon the wet ground and
slept most profoundly.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the London <cite>Morning Herald</cite>, who had
familiar access to Lee's headquarters, in a description of the
battle of the Wilderness, gives this vivid account of the action
of Ramseur's Brigade on the morning of the 12th:</p>

<p>"The Federalists continued to hold their ground in the
salient, and along the line of works, to the left of that angle,
within a short distance of the position of Monoghan's (Hays')
Louisianians. Ramseur's North Carolinians of Rodes' Division
formed, covering Monoghan's right, and being ordered to
charge, was received by the enemy with a stubborn resistance.
The desperate character of the struggle along that brigade-front
was told terribly in the hoarseness and rapidity of its
musketry. So close was the fighting there, for a time, that
the fire of friend and foe rose up rattling in one common
roar. Ramseur's North Carolinians dropped in the ranks
thick and fast, but still he continued, with glorious constancy,
to gain ground, foot by foot. Passing under a fierce
fire, resolutely on, on, on, the struggle was about to become
one of hand-to-hand, when the Federalists shrank from the
bloody trial. Driven back, they were not defeated. The
earthworks being at the moment in their immediate rear, they
bounded on the opposite side; and having thus placed them in
their front, they renewed the conflict. A rush of an instant
brought Ramseur's men to the other side of the defenses; and
though they crouched close to the slopes, under enfilade from
the guns of the salient, their musketry rattled in deep and
deadly fire on the enemy that stood in overwhelming numbers
but a few yards from their front. Those brave North
Carolinians had thus, in one of the hottest conflicts of the
day, succeeded in driving the enemy from the works that had
been occupied during the previous night by a brigade which,
until the 12th of May, had never yet yielded to a foe&mdash;the
Stonewall."</p>

<p>In an address before the Army of Northern Virginia, Colonel
Venable, of Lee's staff, says: "The restoration of the
battle on the 12th, thus rendering utterly futile the success
achieved by Hancock's Corps at daybreak, was a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
feat of arms, in which all the troops engaged deserve the
greatest credit for endurance, constancy, and unflinching courage.
But without unjust discrimination, we may say that
Gordon, Rodes, and Ramseur were the heroes of this bloody
day.... Rodes and Ramseur were destined, alas! in a few
short months, to lay down their noble lives in the Valley of
Virginia. There was no victor's chaplet more highly prized
by the Roman soldier than that woven of the grass of early
spring. Then let the earliest flowers of May be always intertwined
in the garlands which the pious hands of our fair
women shall lay on the tombs of Rodes and Ramseur and of
the gallant dead of the battle of twenty hours at Spottsylvania."</p>

<p>General Long, in his <cite>Life of Lee</cite>, puts the name of Ramseur
in the van of those who rushed into this angle of death
and hurled back the Federals' most savage sallies. During
the long and fierce struggle I saw soldiers place the arms of
their comrades who had just fallen in such a position as when
they had become stiffened they would hold the cartridges we
were using. Yes, fighting and exhausted, amidst blood and
mud and brains, they would sit on the bodies of their fallen
comrades for rest, and dared not show even a finger above the
breastworks, for so terrible was the fire at this angle that a
tree eighteen inches in diameter was cut asunder by minie
balls. After the battle was over Generals Lee and Ewell
thanked Ramseur in person, and directed him to carry to his
officers and men their high appreciation of their conspicuous
services and heroic daring. At this time such portions of the
First and Third Regiments as were not captured in the salient
were placed in the brigade, and it is sufficient praise to bear
witness that from that time on to the surrender at Appomattox
their officers and men always showed themselves
worthy of the highest confidence reposed in them. In appreciation
of the conspicuous services rendered by Ramseur on
this occasion he was made a major-general and assigned to
the command of Early's Division, and I had the distinguished
honor of being assigned to Ramseur's (now to become Cox's)
historic brigade.</p>

<p>The Valley of Virginia, both physically and strategically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
is one of the most attractive regions of that State. It is not
less distinguished for the brilliant achievements of Stonewall
Jackson than for the ardent patriotism of its men and the
devotion and sacrifices of its women to the cause of the South.
It was here that Jackson, with only a little army of thirteen
thousand men, defeated and drove from the valley Milroy,
Frémont, Banks, and Shields, whose combined forces were
five times as great as his own, besides capturing vast quantities
of much needed commissary and ordnance stores and large
numbers of prisoners. After the battle of Cold Harbor the
Second Corps, composed of Ramseur's, Rodes' and Gordon's
Divisions, were placed under the command of Early, and directed
to proceed to this valley, with instructions to capture or
destroy the army of Hunter, a recreant Virginian, who was
marching in the direction of Lynchburg, destroying the country
as he moved along. Attached to this corps were Nelson's
and Braxton's battalions of artillery, together with a division
of cavalry. At this time Breckinridge, who, in a brilliant
engagement, had recently defeated Sigel, was at Lynchburg
awaiting our arrival. Our troops were transported by rail.
Ramseur's and the greater part of Gordon's Division were
sent forward as soon as they were ready. They arrived at
Lynchburg at about 4 o'clock <small>P. M.</small> on the 17th of June.
Here they united with Breckinridge and the troops of Major-General
Ransom, who was in command of the whole cavalry
in the valley. Hunter was in camp near the city of Lynchburg.
In a letter to me, General Ransom says at this
time "he (Ramseur) and I reconnoitered the left flank of
Hunter's army and found it could be most advantageously
assailed, and in person reported the fact to General Early, who
said he would not attack until the whole of Rodes' Division
had arrived from Richmond." The opportunity to destroy
Hunter's army was then lost. Hunter took counsel of his
fears and advantage of the cover of night and darkness to
make a hasty retreat. Early on the morning of the 19th we
commenced a pursuit, and just before night overtook the
enemy's rear at Liberty, when Ramseur's Division moved on
it and drove it through the place. It was now ascertained that
Hunter had not taken the route that we anticipated, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
retreated by way of Buford's Gap, where, on the next day, he
was found occupying a commanding position on the crest of
the mountain. After our arrival we spent the afternoon in
efforts to secure a position from which to successfully assail
him the following day. Hunter, by our failure to promptly
pursue at daylight, made his escape, and, being in the mountains,
further pursuit was useless. Early, in his report, says:
"By mistake of the messenger who was sent with orders to
General Rodes to lead the next morning, there was some
delay in his movement on the 21st, but the pursuit was resumed
very shortly after sunrise." After resting a day we
resumed the march and reached Buchanan that night. Our
next important move was to cross the Potomac into Maryland.
We reached Frederick, Md., about the 9th of the month,
when Ramseur, after a slight resistance, moved through the
town and brushed away the Federals before him. Our invasion
had so alarmed the Federal capital that General Wallace
was directed to move at once with such forces as he had and
could collect and interpose them between us and Washington.
When Wallace reached our front he drew his troops up on
the eastern bank of the Monocacy.</p>

<p>Ramseur deployed in his front, drove his skirmishers across
the river and a brief and brisk artillery duel followed. In the
meantime McCausland, with his cavalry, crossed the river,
attacked the Federal left flank and threw it into confusion,
which Early discovering, threw forward Gordon's Division,
commanded by Breckinridge. Gordon moved to the assistance
of McCausland, while Ramseur crossed over the railroad
bridge and fell upon Wallace, who retreated with great precipitation,
leaving in our hands six or seven hundred prisoners
besides his killed and wounded. Our loss in killed and
wounded was severe, but as this was a sharp and brilliant engagement,
well planned and spiritedly executed, it infused
new life into our troops. On the 10th we moved to Rockville.
As the weather was hot and roads dusty, our troops
were easily fatigued and made but slow progress. The next
day we resumed the march, and in the afternoon reached
Seventh street pike, which leads into Washington. In a history
of the Army of the Potomac, Swinton, in speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
this movement, says: "By afternoon the Confederate infantry
had come up and showed a strong line in front of Fort
Stevens. Early had there an opportunity to dash into the city,
the works being very slightly defended. The hope at headquarters
that the capital could be saved from capture was very
slender." The truth is, the Sixth and Ninth Corps of Grant's
army were then <i>en route</i> to save the capital, and for us to have
entered it at this time might, in the end, have proved a costly
experiment. Probably more expedition might have been exercised
by us in our march. After reconnoitering and skirmishing
a couple of days, we turned our backs on the capital,
beat a hasty retreat to the Potomac, followed by the enemy's
cavalry.</p>

<p>The next engagement of any importance in which Ramseur
was concerned was at Winchester, where he was left with his
command and a battery of artillery to protect the place from a
threatened attack from Averell. While here he was informed
by General Vaughan, in command of the cavalry, that
Averell, with a small force, was at Stephenson's Depot, and
could be surprised and easily captured. Placing too much
confidence in these representations, Ramseur advanced against
him without the proper precaution of throwing forward a
strong skirmish line, and he encountered Averell with a large
force of infantry and cavalry, and met with a pretty severe
repulse. In a letter to me, General W. G. Lewis, who was
wounded in this engagement, says that Ramseur was not altogether
responsible for the mistake that occurred, for he had
every reason to suppose that the information furnished by
Vaughan was correct. This matter, while not of much importance,
is referred to simply because it is the only instance
in which he met with a reverse. The blame properly rests
upon General Vaughan, who should have been more careful
in his statements.</p>

<p>On the 9th of September information reached us that a
large force had been concentrated at Harper's Ferry, which
consisted of the Sixth, Nineteenth, and Crook's Corps, and
was under a new commander, who proved to be Sheridan.
From this time on constant maneuvering and skirmishing
occurred between the two armies, in which Ramseur was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
or less prominently engaged. Sheridan proved to be a wary,
cautious, and prudent commander. In all of these movements
it appeared that his purpose was rather to ascertain the
strength and character of his adversary than to engage him in
battle. Early was disappointed and disgusted by his wary
methods, and says in his <cite>Last Year of the War</cite> that "the
events of the last month had satisfied me that the commander
opposing me was without enterprise and possessed an excessive
caution which amounted to timidity. If it was his policy
to produce the impression that his force was too weak to fight
me, he did not succeed; but if it was to convince me that
he was not an able and energetic commander, his strategy
was a complete success, and subsequent events have not
changed my opinion." Sheridan had recently been transferred
from the Army of the West, where Lee's methods and
"Stonewall Jackson's way" were known as towers of
strength. For the first time Sheridan was given an independent
command, had a wholesome dread of our veterans, and
also fully realized the fact that upon the result of his first
encounter with his adversary there was involved an important
political as well as military element.</p>

<p>Grant's campaign from the "Wilderness to Cold Harbor had
been disappointing to the North, where there was a feeling
that so far the war had been a failure, which, in commenting
on, in his <cite>Campaigns of the Army of the Potomac</cite>, Swinton
says, that when the records of the War Department shall be
carefully examined they will develop discoveries of the most
startling nature. In speaking of public sentiment just prior
to the battle of Winchester, Grant says in his <cite>Personal
Memoirs</cite>:</p>

<p>"I had reason to believe that the administration was a little
afraid to have a decisive battle fought at that time, for fear it
might go against us and have a bad effect on the November
elections. The convention which had met and made its nomination
of the Democratic candidate for the Presidency had
declared the war a failure.</p>

<p>"Treason was talked as boldly in Chicago as ever it had
been at Charleston.</p>

<p>"It was a question of whether the government would then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
have had the power to make arrests and punish those who thus
talked treason.</p>

<p>"But this decisive victory was the most effective campaign
argument made in the canvass."</p>

<p>In addition to what Grant says there was another motive
which made Sheridan timid in encountering our forces, and
possibly Grant's presence was necessary to get him up to the
fighting point.</p>

<p>In his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, Sheridan says:</p>

<p>"I had opposing me an army largely composed of troops
that had operated in this region hitherto under 'Stonewall'
Jackson with marked success, inflicting defeat on the Union
forces almost every time the two armies had come in contact.</p>

<p>"These men were now commanded by a veteran officer of
the Confederacy, General Jubal A. Early, whose past services
had so signalized his ability that General Lee specially
selected him to take charge of the valley district, and notwithstanding
the misfortunes that befell him later, clung to
him to the end of the war. The Confederate army at this
date was about twenty thousand strong, and consisted of
Early's own corps, with Generals Rodes, Ramseur, and Gordon
commanding its divisions; the infantry of Breckinridge,
of Southwestern Virginia; three battalions of artillery, and
the cavalry brigades of Vaughan, Johnson, McCausland, and
Imboden."</p>

<p>Early had marched and countermarched so often in the
presence of and around Sheridan's army without bringing him
to a test of strength he began to think him no better than
Hunter, and entertained more contempt for than fear of him.
He separated his divisions at will, and scattered them from
Winchester to Martinsburg&mdash;twenty-two miles&mdash;with no
greater motive than that of interrupting railroad traffic, producing
a little diversion in Washington, and securing a few
commissaries in Martinsburg. His last movement in this
direction was on the eve of the battle of Winchester. Of this
movement he says: "Having been informed that a force
was at work on the railroad near Martinsburg, I moved on the
afternoon of the 17th of September with Rodes' and Gordon's
Divisions and Braxton's artillery to Bunker Hill; and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
morning of the 18th, with Gordon's Division and a part of
the artillery, to Martinsburg, preceded by a part of Lomax's
cavalry." It will thus be seen that in the presence of a
largely superior force, and a new and untried commander,
Early had his troops stretched out and separated like a string
of glass beads with a knot between each one. In a previous
move of a similar nature on Martinsburg, at Bunker Hill, I
had been reliably informed that the next time Early should
make the mistake of separating his command Sheridan intended
to attack and endeavor to crush his troops in detail.
This fact I communicated to General Rodes, who replied:
"I know it. I have told Early as much"; and with much
irritation of manner, said, "I can't get him to believe it."</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th the booming of cannon was
heard in the direction of Winchester. As skirmishing at this
time was frequent, we could not positively decide as to what it
portended. Rodes was now at Stephenson's Depot, Breckinridge
and Gordon at Bunker Hill, and Ramseur at Winchester.
Rodes received orders to "move out," but was not
directed where to go. We moved out, took position behind a
rock wall north of the road intersecting the Winchester road,
where we anxiously awaited further orders for the space of
two hours. All this time Ramseur, with his seventeen hundred
men, was actively engaged with Sheridan's advance
corps. Had we been properly directed we could have moved
forward and crushed this corps before the remainder of
Sheridan's troops arrived, and secured a complete victory.
In speaking of the time when the firing commenced, Early,
who was with Gordon, says: "I immediately ordered all the
troops that were at Stephenson's Depot to be in readiness to
move, directions being given by Gordon, who had arrived
from Bunker Hill, to move at once, but by some mistake on
the part of my staff officer, the latter order was not delivered
to either Generals Breckinridge or Gordon."</p>

<p>Ramseur was compelled to bear the whole brunt of the
attack of Sheridan's army until we came to his support, about
10 A. M. While Rodes was moving in column up the Martinsburg
road, near Winchester, we were unexpectedly called
to attention, faced to the left, and moved forward to engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
the enemy, who had advanced to within one hundred yards
of the road. Grimes' Brigade was on the right, mine in the
centre, and Cook's on the left, for Battle's was still behind.
After a brief and vigorous assault the Federals commenced
falling back.</p>

<p>Grimes drove the enemy through the woods and formed on
the left of Ramseur, while I was driving the Federals before
me in an open field, supported by Cook on my left. The
latter brigade was brought to a temporary halt. Rodes was
now in my rear, and dispatched his only remaining staff
officer to push forward this brigade. At this moment Lieutenant
J. S. Battle of my staff came up, informed me that
Colonel Bennett of the Fourteenth Regiment had just had
his horse shot under him, and he had given him his. It was
now that General Rodes was shot in the head by a ball, and
caught by Lieutenant Battle as he fell from his horse. The
fall of Rodes was not observed by the troops, who pushed on,
and struck a weak line between the Sixth and Nineteenth
Corps. At this point the Federals were severely punished,
and fell back, leaving their killed and wounded. A large
number of officers and men, secreted in a ditch, were captured.
We pursued the enemy, with a hot fire, beyond the
crest of the hill on which Grimes had established his line.
Here Evans' Brigade, upon meeting a heavy fire, fell back,
which exposed my brigade to a concentrated, direct and left
oblique fire. Seeing that I could not maintain this advanced
position, my aide, Major Gales, was sent to General Early
with a request to have a battery placed on a hill in my rear.
This was promptly done, when my men fell back and were
formed behind the battery, which opening with telling effect
upon their heavy lines, they laid down, and the victory
appeared to be ours. In this brief engagement Colonel
Bennett had two horses shot from under him and was captured.
Colonel Cobb of the Second lost a foot, and Colonel
Thurston of the Third was severely wounded. While
my loss in officers and men had been severe, my troops were
in fine spirits. Here we lay until 4 o'clock in the afternoon,
when Major G. Peyton of the division staff directed me to fall
back, for the infantry had retired from my left, and Fitz Lee's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
cavalry was hotly engaged with that of the Federals. I replied
that there was no occasion for my falling back, as I
could repulse any assault the Federals might attempt; and
upon their endeavoring to advance, I opened fire upon them
and they rapidly sought shelter. Discovering (after Major
Peyton retired) that the Federals were in my rear, I fell back
in good order to the Martinsburg pike and formed on the left
of our troops. Here we were exposed, without any protection,
to a heavy artillery fire, which was inflicting unnecessary
punishment upon my men. I turned to General Breckinridge,
who was near, pointed to a line of hills, and suggested
that that was the place to make our stand, to which
he agreed. Thereupon I faced my men about and commenced
retiring deliberately to the hills, all the troops conforming to
this movement. General Early, through a staff officer, directed
me to return; I thereupon faced my men about and
moved them to the front. Upon reaching the turnpike a
second officer came from General Early and directed me to
fall back. Facing my men about, I again commenced slowly
retiring.</p>

<p>Our troops now retreated towards Fisher's Hill. My brigade
secured the elevation which I had selected, and stood as
a menace to pursuit until our army had measurably retired.
Then proceeding to the turnpike, I was retreating in column,
when Dr. Hunter McGuire, who was with Early, approached
and said General Early was feeling badly; that we had lost
but one caisson, and he wished I would take my troops and
protect from capture the artillery then passing. I informed
him that I was so far from division headquarters (for our
army was not then in sight) that I did not desire to have my
brigade exposed to capture unless he would bring me an order
from General Early, who was then riding slowly along the
pike. He returned to the General and came back and said
the General wished I would do it. I then dispatched
Assistant Adjutant-General Gales to General Battle, who,
after the fall of Rodes, was in command of the division, with
information as to where I was and what I was doing. I
then turned to my command, which had been joined by other
troops who had lost their commands, and directed them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
deploy and advance between the enemy's cavalry and our
artillery, which was done with great spirit and promptness in
the presence of the General, but without a word of indorsement
from him. In this manner we moved on, protecting the
artillery until near dusk, when we found Ramseur with his
division thrown across the turnpike to prevent pursuit. About
the time the artillery and my brigade crossed his line the
enemy made a spirited charge to capture the guns. Ramseur's
men rose and met it with a well-directed fire, which
stopped further pursuit. I moved on and soon joined our
troops. So that Ramseur, upon whom the enemy had opened
their battle in the morning, gave them the last repulse at
night.</p>

<p>Of this battle, Early writing, says: "A skillful and energetic
commander of the enemy's forces would have crushed
Ramseur before any assistance could have reached him, and
thus caused the destruction of my whole force; and later in
the day, when the battle had turned against us, with the immense
superiority of cavalry which Sheridan had and the
advantage of the open country, would have destroyed my
whole force and captured everything I had.... I have
thought, instead of being promoted, Sheridan ought to have
been cashiered for this battle." In his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, Grant
says: "Sheridan moved at the time fixed upon. He met
Early at the crossing of the Opequan Creek and won a most
decisive victory&mdash;one which electrified the country. Early
had invited this attack himself by his bad generalship, and
made the victory easy." Considering the great disparity of
numbers, this battle of Winchester was, after all, no great
victory on the part of Sheridan, and Grant intimates as much,
for his troops outnumbered those of Early more than three to
one. His cavalry was in fine condition, while ours was worn
down by excessive duties and scant forage. It was won at a
critical moment to the Federal government, and it became
to its interest to magnify it in every way practicable.</p>

<p>After our defeat at Winchester we fell back and formed a
line of battle behind Fisher's Hill. In our encounter with
Sheridan's army, notwithstanding our defeat, his loss had
been severe and his pursuit was languid. It was the 20th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
before he reached our front, and several days were passed in
maneuvering and skirmishing. Ramseur's Division occupied
the left of our line of battle and the prolongation of our line
was defended by cavalry. On the 22d, Sheridan threw forward
Crook's Corps, pushed back our cavalry and took possession
of our line. Ramseur hearing the firing to his left,
withdrew my brigade from the line and ordered me to move
in the direction of the firing, for after the fall of Rodes, Ramseur,
to our great gratification, was placed in charge of his
division. On moving to the left I had a brisk skirmish with
a part of Crook's men, but did not encounter the main force.
From the firing in the direction of our line it was soon apparent
that our army was falling back. I now met General
Lomax with a part of his men, and he kindly conducted me
by the nearest route to the turnpike over which we were
retreating.</p>

<p>It was full dusk when we reached the road. Colonel Pendleton,
an admirable officer and an accomplished gentleman
of the corps staff, met me and requested that my brigade be
thrown across the road to cover the retreat. The brigade was
promptly formed, advanced rapidly to a fence, where it met
the enemy in a hand-to-hand encounter, repulsed them and
stopped the pursuit for the night. It was while near me that
Colonel Pendleton, whom I had intimately known when on
Jackson's staff, fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Napoleon said: "The moral force in war is worth twice its
physical effect." Unfortunately from this time on, that
moral force which leads to success in battle was, in this army,
under its present leadership, sadly lacking.</p>

<p>After the affair of Fisher's Hill we fell back to the lower
passes of the Blue Ridge, where Sheridan followed us as far
as Staunton. Then, after destroying the Central Railroad, he
retreated up the valley and took position behind his intrenchments
at Cedar Creek. Early had now been reenforced by
the return of Kershaw's Division, Cutshaw's battalion of
artillery and some cavalry, which about made up his losses
at Winchester and Fisher's Hill. About the time Sheridan
fell back it had been Early's purpose to attack him, which he
doubtless anticipated, for he heard that Longstreet had joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Early, and it was their purpose to destroy him. Early pursued
Sheridan beyond Middletown, where he found him too
strongly intrenched for a direct attack, and we were therefore
formed behind our breastworks at Fisher's Hill. From our
signal station, which overlooked their camp, it was discovered
that the Federal left flank was lightly picketed, and by a long
detour and careful movement could be taken in reverse. A
flanking movement was directed by Early and mainly intrusted
to Gordon, who, with Ramseur's Division, commenced
moving early after dark. The night was consumed in a
fatiguing and exhausting march, which was conducted with
the greatest secrecy. We reached the point at which we were
to cross the creek and make the attack at early dawn. Here
we were joined by Payne's cavalry, who at full speed dashed
upon and captured Sheridan's headquarters, and, but for his
absence, would have captured him. While Crook's Corps
was enjoying its undisturbed quiet, and possibly dreaming of
to-morrow, we descended "like a wolf on the fold" and
aroused them by "Rebel yells" and peals of musketry, and
they hastily fled in garments more suited to a camp than a
ball-room.</p>

<p>After our great reverses the sensation of pursuit was delightful.
As Ramseur hurried from point to point to hasten
forward his troops where resistance was offered his presence
and manner were electrical. Notified of our attack by the firing,
the Federals in other parts of the field formed and offered
some resistance, but they were so much demoralized that my
little brigade drove back a division ten times its numbers after
but slight resistance. By 8 o'clock we had captured nearly
all their artillery and from fifteen hundred to two thousand
prisoners, and the Federals were in retreat. Early in the
meantime, with two divisions which had scarcely been engaged,
came upon the field. Gordon informed me that he
then advised him to seize all his wagon, artillery, and ambulance
horses&mdash;indeed, every one he could get&mdash;mount his men
upon them, and hotly pursue the Federals before they could
recover from their panic. But we were very deliberate.
While this was occurring Sheridan was at Winchester, on his
return from Washington. He gives this graphic account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
his meeting with his fleeing troops: "At Mill Creek my
escort fell behind and we were going ahead at a regular pace
when, just as we made the crest of the rise beyond the stream,
there burst upon our view the appalling spectacle of a panic-stricken
army&mdash;hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs
of others unhurt, but utterly demoralized, and baggage-wagons
by the score, all pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion,
telling only too plainly that a disaster had occurred at
the front. On accosting some of the fugitives, they assured
me that the army was broken up, in full retreat, and that all
was lost; all this with a manner true to that peculiar indifference
that takes possession of panic-stricken men." In the
meantime General Wright, with one division and some cavalry,
had the only organized force in our presence. The
return of Sheridan and the lack of a vigorous pursuit had the
effect to allay the panic with which his army was seized early
in the day. Ascertaining from some prisoners that were captured
that Longstreet was not with Early, Sheridan reorganized
his men the best he could and turned upon us, I should
say about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Ramseur kept his men
well in hand, and from behind rock walls successfully resisted
the advance of the Federals. Near 4 o'clock Kershaw's Division
gave way on my left. I sent my headquarters courier,
private Beggarly, to report the fact to General Ramseur.
While doing so his horse was shot through the ear and the
horse upon which General Ramseur sat (for he refused to take
shelter) was killed. At the request of General Ramseur, private
Beggarly let the General have his horse. So careful was
Ramseur of the rights of others, even in the midst of a severe
engagement, this horse was not taken before getting my consent.</p>

<p>During this whole encounter no man could have behaved
more magnificently and heroically than Ramseur did in his
efforts to resist the overwhelming tide which was now setting
in upon us. From the position which he occupied the retreat
of Kershaw's Division and the overlapping flanking column
of the Federals could be seen. His troops became alarmed
and could not be held in position, and in a vain effort to hold
them this brave and accomplished young officer fell mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
wounded and was captured. In speaking of his conduct
upon this occasion, General Early says: "Major-General
Ramseur has often proved his courage and his capacity to
command, but never did these qualities shine more conspicuously
than on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, when,
after two divisions on his left had given way and his own was
doing the same thing, he rallied a small band, and for one
hour and a quarter held in check the enemy, until he was
shot down himself. In endeavoring to stop those who were
retiring from the field, I had occasion to point them to the
gallant stand made by Ramseur with his small party, and if
his spirit could have animated those who left him thus battling,
the 19th of October would have had a far different history.
He met the death of a hero, <em>and with his fall the last
hope of saving the day was lost</em>! General Ramseur was a
soldier of whom his State has reason to be proud&mdash;he was
brave, chivalrous, and capable." General Grimes says, in his
report of this battle: "Up to the hour of 4 <small>P. M.</small> the troops
of this division, both officers and men, with a few exceptions,
behaved most admirably, and were kept well in hand&mdash;but
little plundering and only a few shirking their duty. After
that hour all was confusion and disorder. The brigade commanders
conducted themselves, each and all, with great coolness
and judgment, and are deserving of especial mention for
using all possible efforts to check their troops, but without
success. The death of the brave and heroic soldier, General
Ramseur, is not only a loss to this division, but to his State
and country at large. No truer and nobler spirit has been
sacrificed in this unjust and unholy war." Colonel Winston,
commanding the Forty-third and Forty-fifth North Carolina
Regiments, says that "only one man of those regiments in
passing through the rich spoils of the enemy's camp fell out
of ranks, and he did it to get a hat, and was court-martialed."
And so far as I observed, the charge of General Early that
the loss of the fruits of our victory in the morning was
ascribable to the plundering of the soldiers, is a great injustice.
Certainly it is an injustice, as applicable to that large body of
North Carolinians who were then in his corps, and who upon
this, as upon prior and subsequent occasions, proved themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
to be among the best soldiers in the Army of Northern
Virginia.</p>

<p>What General Lee said in his letter to General Early, dated
September 22, 1864, in regard to his strategy as a separate
commander, was clear to all, and in the main led to his want
of success. Lee said: ... "As far as I can judge from this
distance, you have operated more with your divisions than
with your constituted strength. Circumstances may have rendered
it necessary, but such a course is to be avoided if possible."
When General Forrest was asked the cause of his
uniform success he replied: "I get there first with the most
men." If not classic, this is at least epigrammatic.</p>

<p>We cheerfully accept the well-merited tribute General
Early pays the chivalrous and knightly Ramseur, but it is insisted
he is entitled to one still higher. Instead of fighting
with a few hundred men, as Early elsewhere says, we see
him, in the language of General Grimes, "holding his division
well in hand," officers and men doing their duty faithfully,
while the disorder and confusion in other parts of the
field hastened the disaster which, with troops skillfully handled,
should not have occurred.</p>

<p>It will be asked if the criticisms of Early's valley campaign
are just, why did not General Lee remove him? There are
several good reasons why General Lee should have been slow
to pursue such a course. Early was a man of superior intelligence,
he was earnest in the cause, and as a brigadier and
division commander a hard fighter and successful officer.
There is, however, a marked difference between a chief and
subordinate commander, and Lee had never known him otherwise
than as a subordinate. It is true that Lee was finally
compelled to remove him, and we may presume it was his
reluctance to wound that caused him to unwillingly take the
step which soon became necessary. This forbearance was in
keeping with Lee's general character as known to those who
served under him. It is so well expressed by Colonel W. H.
Taylor of his staff, in his book entitled <cite>Four Years with
General Lee</cite>, we can but quote from him. He says:</p>

<p>"If it shall be the verdict of posterity that General Lee
in any respect fell short of perfection as a military leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
it may perhaps be claimed: First, that he was too careful
of the personal feelings of his subordinate commanders, too
fearful of wounding their pride, and too solicitous of their
reputation. Probably it was this that caused him sometimes
to continue in command those of whose personal fitness for
their position he was not convinced, and often avowedly or
tacitly assumed responsibility for mishaps clearly attributable
to the inefficiency, neglect or carelessness of others."</p>

<p>Through the courtesy of the family of General Ramseur, I
am placed in the possession of a personal letter from R. R.
Hutchinson, of Virginia, an able and accomplished officer,
who before the battle of Cedar Creek had long served as
Major and Acting Adjutant-General to the division. Major
Hutchinson was with General Ramseur when he received his
fatal wound, was captured while endeavoring to remove him
from the field, and was by his bedside during his last moments.</p>

<p>His account of the sad occurrence on that occasion is so
vivid and touching, that no apology is deemed due for introducing
his letter, with a single omission, in this monograph:</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Near Strasburg, Va.</span>, October 20, 1864.</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Mrs. S. D. Ramseur</span>, <i>Milton, N. C.</i>:<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam:</span>&mdash;I do not know how to write to you; how
to express my deep sympathy in your grievous affliction; but
the Christian soldier who has gone before us to that other
world has asked me to do it, and I must not shrink from the
performance of this duty, however painful. I am writing
by the side of him whose last thought was of you and his God,
his country and his duty. He died this day at twenty-seven
minutes past 10 o'clock <small>A. M.</small>, and had, at least, the consolation
of having by his side some one who wore the same uniform
and served in the same holy cause as himself. His last
moments were peaceful, his wounds were painful, but his
hope in Christ led him to endure <em>all</em> patiently. He received
his mortal wound yesterday afternoon (October 19th) between
the hours of 5 and 6 <small>P. M.</small> at the post of honor and of danger,
where he always was. Our troops had fallen back a short
distance, but had reformed, and were stubbornly contesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
a position on a hill which the enemy attacked from three
sides. He exposed himself to every shot, cheering and encouraging
all. I was not far from him when I saw his horse
shot; he procured another, which was shot also, and immediately
after he received his fatal wound (the second), all in
the space of a very few minutes. I ran over to him, got
some men, and bore him to the rear, your brother joining us
on the way. I then went off after an ambulance, found it,
but saw on returning with it that he had been left, as I
thought, in the enemy's lines. This fear was soon after dissipated,
however, by seeing him on Captain Randolph's horse,
the Captain running alongside and supporting him. We got
him then to the ambulance I had brought up. I thought he
was safe then, not knowing how dangerous was his wound,
and remained with the rear guard. When I was subsequently
captured by the enemy's cavalry, I was carried to
General Sheridan's headquarters, and learning that General
Ramseur had been captured, asked and obtained permission
to remain with him. The road had been blocked up by
wagons, causing a delay that gave the enemy time to get up
and take him prisoner, just south of Strasburg. Many of his
former friends (West Pointers) called to see him yesterday
and to-day, and offered every assistance in their power, General
Sheridan among the number. He was taken to General
Sheridan's headquarters and made as comfortable as circumstances
would permit. Dr. James Gillespie (Cutshaw's battalion
of artillery), a Confederate surgeon, assisted by the
enemy's surgeons, attended to him and did all that could be
done under the circumstances. He suffered a good deal from
his wound, the ball having entered his right side, penetrating
the right and left lung, and lodging near the left side. But
the end was peaceful and quiet. He spoke continually of
you, and sent very many messages to his family, but above
all, to his wife. He told the ambulance driver to tell General
Hoke that he died a Christian and had done his duty.
He told me to give his love and send some of his hair to his
darling wife; and often wished he could see his wife and
little child before he died. He told me to tell you he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
a firm hope in Christ, and hoped to meet you hereafter.
He died as became a Confederate soldier and a firm believer.</p>

<p>"I inclose the lock of hair he desired sent to you.</p>

<p>
"Respectfully,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">R. R. Hutchinson,</span></p>

<p>
"<i>Major and A. A. G. P. A. C. S.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>Ramseur in personal appearance was slight, erect, alert,
earnest in speech, with dark prominent eyes and well developed
forehead. He was an ideal soldier.</p>

<p>General Robert Ransom, in writing of his bearing in action,
while they were together in the valley, says: "Ramseur commanded
infantry and I the whole of Early's cavalry during
the time I was with Early. Whenever I had opportunity
to see Ramseur his conduct was marked by great energy,
brilliant dash (often amounting to impetuosity) and an enthusiasm
which inspired those he led."</p>

<p>Among the soldiers of Napoleon Marshal Ney was known
as "the bravest of the brave." When asked whether he ever
felt fear in battle, he replied that he never had time. His
reply might aptly be that of Ramseur. When in action his
enthusiasm arose with the magnitude of the dangers that environed
him. But this enthusiasm was controlled by a well-directed
judgment as to the best disposition to make of his
troops, and as to the weak points of his adversary. He fully
realized that war meant danger, even death; that the eyes of
his troops were upon him, and their greatest safety lay in
marching fearlessly and promptly to the front of danger, and
he never hesitated to lead them.</p>

<p>On the day preceding the battle of Cedar Creek, General
Ramseur received intelligence of the birth of the little child
mentioned in the letter of Major Hutchinson. The birth of
one's first born arouses a thousand thrilling emotions in the
heart of every manly bosom, which can be felt but not described.</p>

<p>General Ramseur was a superb horseman, and on the day
of the battle he appeared upon the field well mounted and
dressed with unusual care in his handsome general's uniform.
He wore upon the lapel of his coat a <i lang="ht" xml:lang="ht">boutonniere</i>, the gift
doubtless of some fair and patriotic woman in that section,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
bestowed in recognition of the joyous event which he had
made known to her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He died; but his end was fitting,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Foremost in the ranks he led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he marked the heights of his nation's gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As he lay in the harness&mdash;dead."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Rev. E. Harding, his connection and chaplain, in his
sketch of General Ramseur, to which I am indebted in preparing
this memoir, writing of his Christian character, says:
"Ramseur read his Bible a great deal, and when opportunity
offered held family prayers"; he was "fond of conversing
on religious subjects, and punctual in attending divine service";
that he "was a high-toned and chivalrous gentleman,
a gallant soldier, an humble Christian."</p>

<p>His last thoughts on earth were of home and heaven, the
sweetest words in any language. He said bear this message
to my precious wife: "I die a Christian, and hope to meet
her in heaven." No balm to the bruised heart could be more
precious, no assurance more gratifying.</p>

<p>Irrespective of section, irrespective of service, the blue and
the gray&mdash;Sheridan, Custer, Federal and Confederate surgeons&mdash;gather
around his couch to minister to his wants and
smooth his dying pillow. His soul takes its flight, and the
day men called his last was his first in the Paradise of God.
His body was carefully embalmed by the Federals, borne
through their lines and delivered to his early and cherished
friend, General Hoke. And thus was illustrated the saying
that the world would remain at peace if those who made the
quarrels were the only men that fought, for between the soldiers
of the two armies there was no personal animosity&mdash;of
one race, of one nationality, equally brave and equally sincere,
they did not bring on the war, and not with their consent
have its animosities been continued. Ramseur's remains were
carried to his native village, and there a large concourse of
his neighbors and friends assembled to express their sorrow
and do honor to his memory. They accompanied his remains
to their last resting-place, which is in the Episcopal churchyard,
and deposited them beside those of his father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
mother. Over them a loving and devoted kinsman has had
erected a handsome monument, on one side of which is engraved
the Confederate flag and the names of the principal
battles in which he fought, and on the other the date of his
birth and of his death, with this appropriate inscription: "A
Good Soldier of Jesus Christ."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Want of space causes the omission of several pages, not
strictly biographical, of General Cox's sketch, delivered originally
as an address before the Ladies' Memorial Association
of Raleigh, May 10, 1891. It is well enough, however,
that he and others have taken such occasions to give brief
analyses of the causes and motives which shaped events of
which he was an eye-witness and in which he was a conspicuous
actor.</p>

<p>General Cox has shown something of the same nerve and
courage in writing this sketch that characterized him in battle.
In justice to the State and her dead heroes he has uttered
some truths which small men are willing to suppress in the
interest of harmony. His sketch is a valuable chapter of
North Carolina history.</p>

<p>Bryan Grimes, a Major-General in the provisional army of
the Confederate States, was born on the 2d day of November,
1828, at Grimesland, in the county of Pitt, about eight miles
from the town of Washington, N. C., and was the youngest
child of Bryan and Nancy Grimes. He received a good academic
education&mdash;having been a pupil of the late William
Bingham, Sr., and graduated at the University of North
Carolina in June, 1848. For his <em>alma mater</em> he always cherished
a fond remembrance, and the last letter written by him
on the day of his death was one ordering an oil portrait of himself
to be sent to the Philanthropic Society, in accordance
with a request made therefor by that body. Soon after graduating,
his father gave him a valuable plantation in Pitt
county, whereon he resided until the time of his death, with
the exception of the four years during which he was in the
Confederate army. On the 9th of April, 1851, he was married
to Miss Elizabeth Hilliard, daughter of Dr. Thomas
Davis, of Franklin county, who died in November, 1857. The
only surviving issue of this marriage is the wife of S. F. Mordecai,
Esq., of the Raleigh bar. In 1860 he made a visit to
Europe, but returned home soon after Lincoln's election, and,
at the first mutterings of the approaching storm he became
deeply interested in the movements of the Southern States.
As soon as he heard of the bombardment of Fort Sumter he
hastened to the scene of conflict, but arrived after its surrender.
Thence he visited Pensacola, which was then threatened
with an attack, and then went on to New Orleans, returning
home early in the month of May to find that, during his
absence, his friends had nominated him as a candidate for a
seat in the State Convention, and to which he was elected
without opposition. That body is known as the "Secession
Convention," and was the most remarkable&mdash;composed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
ablest men&mdash;ever assembled in North Carolina. The ordinance
of secession was signed on the ever-memorable 20th of
May, and, in a few days thereafter, General Grimes, feeling
that duty called him to the tented field, resigned his seat in
the Convention and accepted the appointment of Major of the
Fourth Regiment of State Troops, then organizing at Garysburg.
He was also, at the same time, offered by Governor
Ellis the positions of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Eighth Regiment
and Major of the Second Regiment of Cavalry, but he
declined these offers because he felt his deficiency in the
knowledge of military tactics (never having had any military
training whatsoever), and wished to have the benefit of the
military knowledge and experience of the Colonel of the
Fourth Regiment, George B. Anderson, who was a graduate
of West Point, and one of the best officers of the old army.
Without delay he joined his regiment at Garysburg, where it
remained drilling until ordered to Richmond, and arrived at
Manassas only a few days after the victory at that place.
During the remainder of the year and until March, 1862, his
regiment was stationed near Manassas, and he was in command
of it most of that period, as Colonel Anderson had been
appointed commandant of the post at Manassas.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May, Major Grimes was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel
of his regiment, and a night or two thereafter,
when Yorktown was evacuated, he was assigned the very
responsible position of commander of the picket line, with
instructions to keep up, as usual, the firing throughout the
night and retire about dawn, which perilous duty was most
successfully and gallantly performed. At the battle of Williamsburg,
on the 5th of May, the Fourth Regiment was
only slightly engaged, and was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Grimes, as Colonel Anderson was commanding the
brigade. But soon thereafter, on the 31st of May, at Seven
Pines, that gallant regiment received its baptism of fire&mdash;the
most bloody ever recorded. Lieutenant-Colonel Grimes led
his regiment into that battle with twenty-five officers and five
hundred and twenty non-commissioned officers and privates,
and out of that number every officer, except himself, and four
hundred and sixty-two men, were either killed or wounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
Such carnage is almost unparalleled in the annals of war, and
seems incredible! In this battle the escape of Colonel Grimes
seems miraculous. He acted with a bravery that rendered
him conspicuous even in such a band of heroes. In attacking
the enemy's fortifications his horse's head was blown off by
a cannon ball, and the horse fell so suddenly as to catch his
foot and leg under it. While in this position the regiment,
thinking that he was killed, began to waver, when he, pinned
to the ground by the dead horse, waved his sword and shouted,
"Forward! Forward!" whereupon some of the men came to
his assistance and pulled the horse off, and thus freed, he
sprang to his feet, seized the flag of the regiment that was
lying on the ground (the color-bearer and all the color-guard
having been killed or wounded), and rushing forward, called
upon his men to charge, which they did most gallantly, and
captured the fortifications. Most nobly did the gallant
Grimes, in this bloody charge, prove himself the worthy
leader of such heroes! On the 19th of June, 1862, he was
appointed Colonel of his regiment, Colonel Anderson having
received his commission as Brigadier-General. The next
battle in which Colonel Grimes was engaged was at Mechanicsville,
on the 26th of June, where, with no officers and a
mere handful of men, his regiment rendered most efficient
service, and where he had another horse killed under him.
After this battle Colonel Grimes, with his regiment, was detailed
by General D. H. Hill to take charge of the captured
stores and prisoners and report with them at Richmond. General
Anderson protested against this, paying Colonel Grimes
the high compliment of saying "Although small in numbers,
Colonel Grimes' regiment is the key-stone of my brigade."</p>

<p>After remaining around Richmond until the middle of
July, he was seized with typhoid fever and returned to
Raleigh until he recovered. He rejoined his command in
time to take part in the first Maryland campaign and the
battles previous to the crossing of the Potomac. When crossing
the Potomac, on the 5th of September, he received a very
severe hurt upon the leg from the kick of a horse, causing a
permanent indentation of the bone, and rendering him incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
for several days of walking or riding horseback. On the
14th of September was fought the bloody battle of Boonsboro,
where Colonel Grimes, although really unfit for duty, again
acted with conspicuous courage and had another horse killed
under him; and just here it may be proper to mention that altogether
during the war he had seven horses shot under him in
battle. The exertions of the day exhausted him and rendered
his injured leg so much worse that General Anderson insisted
upon his being carried to a hospital in the rear, where amputation
was seriously talked of. His injury incapacitated him
for further service until November, when he was assigned
to the temporary command of General Anderson's Brigade,
that officer having been mortally wounded on the 17th of
September, at Sharpsburg. Colonel Grimes commanded this
brigade at the battle of Fredericksburg with much skill and
judgment, and remained in command until February, when
he was relieved by Brigadier-General Ramseur. During the
remainder of the winter and until the opening of the campaign
in May, Colonel Grimes diligently drilled his regiment
until it became noted for its proficiency in military tactics and
soldierly discipline.</p>

<p>During the next campaign Colonel Grimes and his regiment
passed through a most fiery ordeal and nobly sustained
their well-won reputation. On the 1st of May, 1863, began
the battles around Chancellorsville. In the first day's fight
Colonel Grimes' Regiment and a Mississippi regiment were
detailed "to feel" the enemy, which they did in gallant style,
driving everything before them until the main body of
Hooker's army was reached. General Jackson himself accompanied
Colonel Grimes in this movement, and when much
resistance was shown by the enemy, would say, in suppressed
tones: "Press them, Colonel." On the second day Colonel
Grimes and his regiment took an active part in routing Sigel's
Corps, and on the third day an incident occurred that deserves
special mention. On the morning of the 3d of May
General Ramseur's Brigade, having borne the brunt of the
fights of the two previous days, was held in reserve to support
other troops who were to take the advance. The brigade
rested just in rear of a ... brigade of previous good reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
which occupied the breastworks captured the day before
by Ramseur's Brigade. A staff officer of General J. E. B.
Stuart rode up to the officer in command of the ... brigade
and gave orders to advance and charge the enemy, General
Ramseur and Colonel Grimes standing near by and hearing
the order given. The ... officer declined to move forward,
whereupon General Ramseur said to the staff officer, "Give
me the order, and I will charge." He was then told to make
the charge. He and Colonel Grimes hurried back to their
troops, and, at the command "Forward!" moved up to the
earthworks occupied by the ... brigade, and actually
climbed over these men now lying down behind it for protection,
and over the breastworks, and then formed in line of
battle under a murderous fire. Colonel Grimes was so disgusted
with the cowardly conduct of the ... troops that,
in passing over them, he singled out an officer of high rank
who was lying down, and placing one foot on his back and
the other on his head, with contempt and fierce indignation
ground his face in the earth. After climbing over the breastworks
and forming in line of battle, Ramseur's Brigade
rushed forward, Colonel Grimes' Regiment and three companies
of the Second Regiment not halting or firing a gun
until they had captured the enemy's works and bayoneted
the Federal soldiers on the opposite side of the earthworks.
The remainder of the brigade had in the meantime halted to
deliver their fire on encountering the enemy where they were
engaged. This was one of the few times during the war
when the opposing troops actually crossed bayonets, and where
an inferior force in broad daylight, without firing a gun, captured
breastworks held by superior numbers and drove them
out at the point of the bayonet! In this charge Colonel
Grimes' sword was severed by a ball, his clothing perforated
in many places&mdash;a ball imbedded in his sword-belt and scabbard
and he received a severe contusion on the foot. His
regiment suffered fearfully, forty-six being killed and one
hundred and fifty-seven wounded out of three hundred and
twenty-seven carried into action. Truly may we claim that
this charge was as gallant, daring, and self-sacrificing as the
world-renowned charge of "the immortal six hundred" at
Balaklava!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Pennsylvania campaign Colonel Grimes and his
regiment were with the advance, and went on picket duty only
eight miles from Harrisburg, the capital of the State. While
on picket duty there, about five hundred Pennsylvania
militia, wearing high, sugar-loaf hats, marched out to drive
back the "bloody Rebels." As soon as Colonel Grimes caught
sight of them he placed a portion of his men in ambush, who,
as soon as the militia passed, opened fire in their rear, while
those in front raised the terrifying "Rebel yell" and charged
them. Of course the militia were completely stampeded,
and sought shelter in the neighboring fields, dropping in their
flight their hats, with which Colonel Grimes' men supplied
themselves. In the first day's fight at Gettysburg Colonel
Grimes and his regiment were the first to enter that town
and drove the enemy through Gettysburg to the heights beyond,
capturing more prisoners than there were men in his
command. Had this temporary success been followed
promptly by Lee's army Gettysburg would not have sounded
the death-knell of the Southern Confederacy!</p>

<p>In the retreat from Pennsylvania Colonel Grimes was
placed in the rear guard and assisted most efficiently in protecting
the retreating army. It seems always to have been
the fate of this officer to occupy the post of honor and danger&mdash;in
the front in every advance and in the rear in every
retreat, beginning with Yorktown, in 1862, and ending at
Appomattox, in 1865. This fact speaks louder than any
words the great confidence placed in him by his superior
officers.</p>

<p>On the 5th day of September, 1863, Colonel Grimes was
married to Miss Charlotte Emily, daughter of the late Honorable
John H. Bryan, of Raleigh. This lady now survives
him, with four daughters and four sons. May the latter
prove themselves to be worthy scions of so noble a sire, and
their mother be enabled to point them out as her jewels,
as did the mother of the Gracchi! In October, 1863, the
friends of Colonel Grimes urged him to become a candidate to
represent the Second District in the Confederate Congress, and
at first he yielded to their wishes; but upon further consideration,
he declined the honor, and published a letter, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
well illustrated his unselfish patriotism, in which he stated
that he "preferred to remain in active service in the field
until peace and independence were secured." In November
Colonel Grimes was placed in command of the brigade for
the second time, while General Ramseur was at home on a
furlough. The following winter was spent quietly, both
armies preparing for the great conflict that was soon to begin
at the Wilderness. Commencing on the 5th day of May,
1864, there was one almost continuous battle for a month,
fighting all day and at night resting on their arms in line of
battle. Colonel Grimes was actively engaged every day, but
his services on the 12th and 19th days of May deserve especial
mention. The Federal troops, by a sudden movement, had
surprised that portion of the Confederate breastworks known
as the "Horse Shoe," and captured about two thousand men
belonging to General Edward Johnson's Division. It was
necessary to retake this position, and Ramseur's Brigade was
selected for this difficult task. The charge was ordered, and
while being gallantly made, General Ramseur was wounded,
and was not able to keep up. At this critical juncture Colonel
Grimes, seeing the need for prompt action, assumed the
responsibility of ordering a second charge, himself leading it,
and recovered the entire works and all the guns, capturing
many prisoners and killing more of the enemy than the brigade
numbered men. General Lee himself rode down, and
in person thanked the brigade for its gallantry, telling them
that they deserved the thanks of the country&mdash;they had
saved his army.</p>

<p>General Junius Daniel having been mortally wounded on
the 12th of May, Colonel Grimes was placed in command of
that lamented officer's brigade, and soon thereafter received
his well-deserved commission of brigadier-general. This
commission, though not received until the 5th of June, bore
date May 19th, on which day he had handled the brigade
with such efficiency (on a flank movement towards the rear
of Grant's army) that General Rodes (the division commander)
approached him soon after the battle, and, shaking
him by the hand, said: "You have saved Ewell's Corps, and
shall be promoted, and your commission shall bear date from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
this day." Upon being assigned to the command of Daniel's
Brigade, General Grimes' old regiment (the Fourth) made
application to be transferred to that brigade, in order to be
with their old commander, but their request, in which General
Grimes heartily joined, was not granted. Still they were
in the same division, and on every occasion possible General
Grimes' old regiment testified their affection for him.</p>

<p>About the middle of June, Grimes' Brigade, with the other
troops of Ewell's Corps (now commanded by General Jubal
Early), was ordered to the Valley of Virginia, and began a
series of movements almost unparalleled in war. They
quickly drove the Federal forces, commanded by General
Hunter, entirely out of Virginia, although the latter greatly
outnumbered them. Forced marches were made almost every
day, and the men were exhausted by hunger as well as by
fatigue, and yet they marched on, crossed the Potomac, threatened
Baltimore, alarmed the government at Washington, and
defiantly flaunted their blood-stained banners in sight of the
very dome of the Capitol!</p>

<p>In July General Grimes went home on a sick furlough, but
soon returned to active duty, although still sick and having a
surgeon's certificate of unfitness for duty. He could not
remain at home while his services were so much needed at
the front. Until the 19th of September Early's forces were
generally victorious in every skirmish and battle, but on that
fatal day a victory was turned into a rout, the enemy's vastly
superior numbers overwhelming the Confederates and disastrously
defeating them. Here fell the division commander,
General R. E. Rodes, than whom there was no better officer
in the Army of Northern Virginia. In this battle General
Grimes greatly distinguished himself, and his escape was marvelous,
he being in the thickest of the fight, his horse shot
under him and nearly every member of his staff severely
wounded. A month afterwards, on the 19th of October,
Early's army was again defeated by overwhelming numbers.
General Grimes made desperate efforts to stem the tide, exposing
himself with an utter indifference to danger in his
efforts to rally the panic-stricken troops, and having two horses
shot under him. General Ramseur, who had succeeded Rodes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
in the command of the division, was mortally wounded in this
battle, and General Grimes was placed in command of the
division and retained that command until Lee's surrender, his
commission as major-general being issued in the following
February. This division was composed of as gallant a body
of men as ever marched to battle, and had greatly distinguished
itself in every campaign. For two years it had been
commanded by General Rodes, who was one of General Lee's
most trusted officers, and under its new commander&mdash;the gallant
Grimes&mdash;it well sustained its brilliant reputation. It
was composed of four brigades, two from North Carolina, one
from Alabama, and one from Georgia. One of the North
Carolina brigades was Daniel's old brigade&mdash;afterwards
Grimes'&mdash;and the other was formerly Ramseur's, now commanded
by General W. R. Cox. While North Carolina may
well be proud of all her troops in the late civil war, she has
especial cause to be proud of such heroes as composed those
two brigades. The Alabama brigade had won at Seven Pines
a reputation that was well sustained afterwards on many a
hard-fought field. Its commander, General Cullen Battle,
was so severely wounded at Winchester as not to be able to
return again to active duty. The Georgia brigade, though
the smallest in the division, always did its full duty, its first
commander having been General Doles, who fell at Spottsylvania,
and its second, General Phil. Cook, who was wounded at
Hare's Hill and captured at the evacuation of Petersburg.</p>

<p>Immediately upon assuming command of the division, General
Grimes actively set about removing all effects of the
recent defeats it had sustained. He was busily engaged in
reorganizing and inspecting the regiments, and enforcing the
most rigid discipline. The result was that in a month's time,
on the 22d of November, his division by itself routed four
thousand of Sheridan's formidable cavalry. The week before
Christmas Grimes' Division went into winter quarters on
Swift Creek, about three miles from Petersburg, and for a few
weeks enjoyed a comparative rest, which was greatly needed.
On the 15th of February, General Grimes, with his division,
left winter quarters and encamped near Southerland's Station,
about twelve miles from Petersburg, protecting Lee's right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
wing, where they remained until the middle of March, when
they occupied the trenches in front of Petersburg, relieving
Bushrod Johnson's Division. The line of fortifications occupied
by Grimes' Division extended from near the famous
"Crater" on the left to a dam beyond Battery No. 45 on the
right, a distance of at least three and a half miles. To defend
this extended line General Grimes had only about two
thousand two hundred men, and one-third of them constantly
on picket duty. Men may well wonder then why Grant's
greatly superior numbers did not sooner break through this
attenuated line. No one who himself did not experience a
soldier's life in the trenches around Petersburg can appreciate
the dangers and hardships then endured by the men of
Grimes' Division. The trenches were usually knee-deep in
mud, the men always on the alert and ready for action, one-third
always on picket duty in the rifle-pits, one-third kept
awake at the breastworks every night, and one-third only off
duty at a time, and they sleeping on their arms and with
accoutrements on, as best they could, amid the continuous
firing along the picket line. All night long the pickets kept
up an incessant firing, the sound resembling at a distance the
popping of fire-crackers, and the flash of the rifles illumining
the darkness like fire-flies on a summer's night, while now and
then a mortar shell would gracefully glide through the air
and explode with a deafening roar. And yet those brave men
endured all this, day after day and night after night, without
a murmur, and on the 25th of March made one of the most
desperate attacks of the war. On that day General Lee made
his last and final effort to break through the coils of Grant's
encircling army. It was a desperate undertaking, and came
well-nigh being successful. At one point in front of Petersburg,
near Hare's Hill, the breastworks of the two armies were
only about one hundred yards apart, and General Lee determined
to make a sudden sortie at this place and capture the
enemy's line. A day or two before the attack was to be
made Generals Gordon and Grimes visited this point, and
carefully inspected the fortifications and acquainted themselves
with the nature of the ground. Just before day-dawn
the sharpshooters of Grimes' Division&mdash;about three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
men&mdash;with unloaded muskets and in profound silence, leaped
over our breastworks, dashed across the open space in front,
surprising and capturing the enemy's pickets before they
could give the alarm, and had mounted their breastworks and
were upon the enemy before they could realize their situation.
A brigadier-general and five hundred men were sent
back as prisoners, and the remainder of the division followed
the sharpshooters and occupied the enemy's works. Other
troops, among whom were Ransom's and Lewis' North Carolina
Brigades, had at the same time captured other portions of
the enemy's works, and a brilliant victory seemed within our
grasp, but it was only the meteor's flash that illumines for a
moment and leaves the night darker than before. The expected
reenforcements, Pickett's Division, did not come to
their support, and the enemy soon collected a force ten times
as large as ours and poured so destructive a fire upon our
men that they were withdrawn after a most stubborn fight of
two hours. General Lee himself overlooked the scene of conflict
from a hill near the old Blandford Cemetery, and well
do I remember the sad expression of his face as we passed
him in returning to our quarters. In this short engagement
Grimes' Division lost four hundred and seventy-eight officers
and men. This was the first battle in which General Grimes
was engaged after receiving his commission as major-general,
and he acted with more than his usual gallantry, if such a
thing be possible. He was the only Confederate on horseback&mdash;riding
a captured horse&mdash;and thus rendering himself a conspicuous
target for the enemy's fire, but, notwithstanding his
great danger, he rode up and down the lines, urging on and
encouraging his men, who, enthused with admiration of his
dauntless courage, cheered him most lustily.</p>

<p>But the end was rapidly drawing near. On Saturday
night, April 1st, about ten o'clock, the enemy opened a heavy
artillery and mortar fire, and by a sudden dash captured a
portion of the picket line held by Grimes' Division. General
Grimes at once informed General J. B. Gordon, who commanded
the corps, of the situation, and that, if the enemy
charged his weak line, he would not be able to resist them.
But there were no reenforcements to be sent, for Lee's lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
had been broken at other points, and although our picket line
was soon reestablished, yet shortly before daylight the Federal
forces in large numbers attacked and captured that portion
of our line known as Rune's Salient, held by Battle's
Alabama Brigade. The enemy at once extended their line
some distance up and down our breastworks before they could
be checked. In a few minutes, however, General Grimes, on
foot, rushed down the line, calling on his old brigade to follow
him, and began rallying the troops who were retiring before
the advancing enemy. Seizing a musket from a soldier, General
Grimes himself opened fire on the enemy, and by his cool
courage soon restored confidence to his men, and the enemy's
further advance was promptly checked. Fighting continued
until late in the day, and our troops not only successfully
resisted any further advance of the enemy, but drove them
back from traverse to traverse until the space in our breastworks
occupied by them was not two hundred yards long.
The fighting that day was desperate and bloody, being at such
close quarters, and Grimes' Division&mdash;especially Grimes' old
brigade&mdash;suffered heavily. If all of Lee's army could have
held back the enemy that day as successfully as did Grimes'
Division, Petersburg would not that night have been evacuated.
But orders were received for our withdrawal, and
shortly after dark the main body of the division retired from
the trenches, marched through Petersburg and crossed the
Appomattox river. A force of about two hundred and fifty
men was left at the breastworks to cover the retreat of the
main body, and this little band remained there, keeping up a
brisk fire until after midnight, and then quietly followed the
route taken by the division, being the last troops to leave
Petersburg; and well do I remember crossing the Appomattox
river on the old Pocahontas Bridge while the railroad
bridge near by was burning brightly and making a light by
which the enemy's artillery was directed at us.</p>

<p>Time would fail me and your patience would be exhausted,
were I to attempt a detailed recital of the part taken by General
Grimes on that memorable retreat from Petersburg to
Appomattox. Always placed at the post of danger, his division
rendered conspicuous service. Now stubbornly resisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
the advance of superior numbers flushed with victory, now
turning like a wounded lion upon his pursuers and charging
desperately and putting to flight a too confident foe, and now
toiling along over muddy roads, famished with hunger, exhausted
with constant marching day and night, almost stupefied
with the want of sleep, those men proved themselves to be
heroes indeed&mdash;the equals of any the world has ever seen!</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 6th of April, the enemy pressed us most
pertinaciously, and that afternoon, at Sailor's Creek, overwhelmed
our exhausted troops; and at this place General
Grimes made a most wonderful escape. And yet, notwithstanding
their rout that afternoon, on the next day those
men were as ready for battle as ever before, and made a most
brilliant charge, with the old Confederate yell, recapturing
the line from which General Mahone's Division had just been
driven. General Lee himself was near, and saw this charge,
and at once sent for General Grimes, and in person thanked
him for this service rendered by him and his division.</p>

<p>And now we come to the last sad scenes at Appomattox
Court House, where General Grimes planned and led the last
charge made by the Army of Northern Virginia. General
Lee had been trying to carry his army to Lynchburg, but the
enemy had in overwhelming numbers thrown themselves in
his front to head him off. Thereupon Grimes' Division,
which always occupied the post of greatest danger, was hurried
from the rear, where it had been covering the retreat,
and placed in the advance. Shortly before daylight on that
memorable Sunday, the 9th of April, 1865, our troops arrived
at the village of Appomattox Court House, when it was
ascertained that the enemy in strong numbers were in our
immediate front. On the night before the last council of
war had been held at General Lee's headquarters, which was
attended by Generals Lee, Longstreet, Gordon, Pendleton, and
Fitzhugh Lee, and the plan agreed upon was that Gordon's
Corps and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry were to attack the enemy
next morning and attempt to cut a way out, and the other
troops and wagon-train were to follow. It was then thought
that only Sheridan's cavalry were in our front, and that they
could be forced back. Soon after General Grimes arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
at Appomattox, Generals Gordon and Fitzhugh Lee joined
him and held a conference as to what should be done. Gordon
insisted that the enemy's troops were cavalry and that Fitzhugh
Lee should attack, while the latter contended that they
were infantry and that Gordon should attack. They discussed
this so long, and so much valuable time was being lost, that
General Grimes became impatient and said that it was somebody's
duty to make the attack, and that at once, and that he
would undertake it; whereupon General Gordon told him to
do so, and placed under his command, in addition to his own
division, the other two divisions of the corps, Evans' and
Walker's&mdash;Bushrod Johnson's Division and Wise's Brigade
having been placed under his command two or three days
previously. General Grimes at once rode forward, made all
the necessary arrangements, placed the troops in proper positions,
and gave the signal to advance, which was done in gallant
style, our troops charging the enemy and driving them
back nearly a mile. General Grimes then sent a message
to General Gordon, announcing his success and that the road
to Lynchburg was now open for the escape of the wagons.
Then, to his great surprise, he received orders to retire, which
he declined to do, thinking that General Gordon did not
understand the commanding position held by him. Gordon
continued to send orders to withdraw, which General Grimes
continued to disregard, still thinking that General Gordon was
in ignorance of his position, until finally an order to retire
came from General Lee himself, and then sullenly and slowly
our men began to retrace their steps over the ground from
which they had so successfully driven the enemy. This withdrawal
was conducted in an orderly manner, although in the
immediate front of a greatly superior force. At one time
the enemy with loud cheers made a sudden rush as if to overwhelm
our little band, but the brigade of General W. R.
Cox (which was bringing up the rear) faced about, and with
the steadiness of veterans on parade poured such a sudden
and deadly volley into the astonished Federals that they hastily
retired in confusion, and our troops were then allowed to withdraw
without further molestation. This was the last volley
fired at Appomattox and the last ever fired by the grand old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Army of Northern Virginia! General Grimes having thus
successfully withdrawn his men to their original position,
rode up to General Gordon and inquired where he should
form line of battle, to which he replied, "Anywhere you
choose." Struck by so strange an answer, General Grimes
asked an explanation, when he was informed that General Lee
was then negotiating a surrender. At this astounding intelligence,
General Grimes expressed himself very forcibly and
indignantly upbraided General Gordon for not giving him
notice of such intention, so that he could have escaped with
his troops and joined General Joe Johnston's army, then near
Raleigh. So horrible to General Grimes was the idea of surrendering
that he turned his horse and started towards his
command with the intention of informing his men of the
approaching surrender and telling all, who might desire to do
so, that they might escape with him. But General Gordon
quickly overtook him, and placing his hand on his shoulder,
asked him if he were going to desert the army and tarnish his
honor as a soldier, and added that it would be a reflection upon
General Lee and an indelible disgrace to him (Grimes), if he,
an officer of high rank, should escape while a flag of truce was
pending. Of course such an appeal had its immediate effect,
for General Grimes' great courage was only equalled by his
high sense of honor. But never can I forget his manner and
the expression of his face while awaiting the final announcement
of the surrender. He resembled a caged lion eager to
break loose and scatter his tormentors. But the end had
come, the Army of Northern Virginia had surrendered, the
star of the young Confederacy had forever set, its tattered and
blood-stained banners were forever furled, and its brave defenders,
with "the consciousness of duty well performed,"
returned to their desolated homes and devastated fields. There
a new duty awaited them. They realized that "peace hath
her victories no less renowned than war," and at once went
to work to build up the waste places. They had perilled
their lives on an hundred carnage-covered fields because of
their love for their native land, and they were now ready
to work for her material prosperity. They thought of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
beloved South, devastated as she was, as Byron exclaimed of
Greece,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More rich than other climes' fertility;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Animated by these feelings, General Grimes, at the close
of the war, returned to his farm and diligently applied himself
to its cultivation, leading the quiet life of a country gentleman,
his greatest pleasure being the society of his family and
friends. Brave in war, he was gentle in peace; the bold soldier
became the courteous gentleman, whose home was the
seat of a refined and open-handed hospitality. With his
ample means, he was ever ready to relieve the wants of the
needy, and with his warm and generous heart he ever sympathized
with the sufferings of the afflicted.</p>

<p>On the 14th day of August, 1880, while returning home
from the town of Washington, N. C., this hero of an hundred
battles was shot from the roadside by a concealed assassin and
almost instantly killed. I cannot here trust myself to speak
of the circumstances connected with his foul assassination&mdash;which
will ever excite the fiercest indignation in every manly
heart&mdash;but be it said to the everlasting disgrace of the administration
of justice in North Carolina, his assassin escaped
punishment!</p>

<p>In reviewing the military record of General Grimes, it
seems almost incredible that any one, without the slightest
previous military experience or training, should have attained
his high rank or rendered such efficient services. Not only
did he win the love and admiration of his soldiers, but the
confidence and esteem of his superior officers. While a strict
disciplinarian, he was remarkably careful of the comfort of
his troops, and they never endured any hardships or dangers
in which he did not willingly share. Indeed I have often
known him to peril his own life in order to protect his men.</p>

<p>In recommending his promotion for Brigadier-General,
Generals Ramseur and Daniel were very complimentary, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
that, "In battle Colonel Grimes is conspicuous for skill
and gallantry. As a disciplinarian, Colonel Grimes has few
superiors. He is ever zealous in the performance of military
duty, and in providing for and taking care of his men."</p>

<p>Major-General Rodes endorsed this recommendation as follows:
"I take pleasure in endorsing Colonel Grimes' claims
to promotion. He has served in this division since its formation
at Yorktown, and shown himself under all circumstances
to be a good and reliable officer. He is a thorough
gentleman, brave to a fault, invaluable in an action, and his
habits are worthy of imitation."</p>

<p>In March, 1863, General D. H. Hill urged his promotion,
saying: "Colonel Bryan Grimes entered the service as Major
of the Fourth North Carolina Regiment, and for more
than a year had the admirable training of the lamented General
G. B. Anderson, who was Colonel of that regiment. Colonel
Grimes led the Fourth with most distinguished gallantry
at Seven Pines, and in all the subsequent battles of the year
1862 except Sharpsburg (when he was ill). He has been in
many pitched battles, and has behaved most gallantly in them
all. I think that he has seen more service than any Colonel
from North Carolina. His gallantry, ripe experience, admirable
training, intelligence and moral worth constitute strong
claims for promotion."</p>

<p>With such testimonials from such Generals as Ramseur,
Daniel, Rodes, and D. H. Hill, the friends of General Grimes
may well feel proud of his reputation as a soldier, and nothing
that I might say could add to it. No high-sounding words of
praise are needed to perpetuate his memory. His heroic
deeds and illustrious achievements are themselves sufficient,
and will so brightly illumine the pages of North Carolina's
history that words of eulogy would be dimmed by their brilliancy.
And yet I cannot close without paying a slight
tribute to one whom I loved while living, and whose memory
I now so fondly cherish. It was my privilege, though a
beardless boy, to have enjoyed the friendship of General
Grimes and to have been with him on occasions that indeed
"tried men's souls," and to-day it affords me peculiar pleasure
and pride to declare that in devotion to every duty, in faithfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
to every trust, in sincerity of purpose, in dauntless
courage, in unselfish patriotism&mdash;in everything that constitutes
a noble, generous, true man&mdash;North Carolina has never
honored a son superior to <span class="smcap">Bryan Grimes</span>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General Grimes was one of those men of iron nerve whom
the God of battle raises up wherever a noble cause is to be
defended. He was a strong man, loved truth, hated shams,
and learned war to defend his country. His life is well told
by his courier, H. A. London, Esq., in his address delivered
May 10, 1886, and will be read with especial interest, not
only by his old soldiers, but by all who seek to set before the
minds of youth exemplars of valor. It is sad that he, who
bore a charmed life in the war, was reserved by fate for the
hand of an assassin. His account of the surrender at Appomattox
is the simple, unvarnished statement of an eye-witness
and participant of those stirring scenes, who told the truth
as he saw it and believed it, and whose strong character you
can feel through his words.</p>

<h3><a name="SURRENDER_AT_APPOMATTOX" id="SURRENDER_AT_APPOMATTOX">SURRENDER AT APPOMATTOX.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY BRYAN GRIMES.</p>


<p>On the night of Saturday, April 1, 1865, my division occupied
a portion of the defenses around the city of Petersburg,
my left resting on Otey's Battery, near the memorable crater,
my right extending to the dam on a creek beyond Battery
Forty-five. Ramseur's old Brigade of North Carolinians,
commanded by Colonel W. R. Cox (holding appointment as
temporary Brigadier) was on the right; Archer's Brigade of
Virginia Junior Reserves, and Grimes' old brigade of North
Carolinians, commanded by Colonel D. G. Cowand of the
Thirty-second North Carolina, Battle's Brigade of Alabamians,
commanded by Colonel Hobson, of the Fifth Alabama,
Cook's Brigade of Georgians, commanded by Colonel Nash,
extended to the left in the order above named, numbering for
duty about two thousand two hundred muskets, covering at
least three and a half miles of the trenches around Petersburg.
One-third of my men were constantly on picket duty
in our front, one-third kept awake at the breastworks during
the night, with one-third only off duty at a time, and they were
required always to sleep with their accoutrements on and
upon their arms, ready to repel an attack at a moment's
warning.</p>

<p>About 10 o'clock on the night of April 1, 1865, the cannonading
from the artillery and mortars in my front became
unusually severe, and about 11 o'clock the Federals charged,
capturing my picket line, which consisted of pits dug in the
earth for protection from sharpshooters, and occupied by my
soldiers, varying in distance from one hundred and fifty to
three hundred yards in front of our main breastworks. I
took measures immediately to reestablish this line, which was
successfully accomplished, and our pits reoccupied. About
daylight of the second the enemy again drove in our pickets
and charged Rune's salient at the point where Battle's Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
was posted, carrying the works for a few hundred yards
on each side of that point, doubling and throwing Cook's Brigade
back a short distance. I hurried the commands of
Colonels Cowand and Archer to the point of attack as rapidly
as possible, charging the enemy, who were in possession
of and protected by our traverses and bomb-proofs (which were
erected to prevent our line being enfiladed, and also as a place
of refuge from their perpendicular mortar fire), and continued
gradually to gain traverse after traverse of our captured
works.</p>

<p>I then secured four pieces of artillery, which were placed
in our second line of works, and were invaluable in checking
the advance of the enemy, thus confining them by grape and
canister to this particular point at the salient, preventing their
advancing to attack our lines in flank or rear; Cook and
Battle holding them in check on the left, and Cowand and
Archer on the right of the captured works, their only point
of egress being exposed to the fire of the artillery.</p>

<p>I regret my inability to recall the names and thus give
honorable mention to those gallant artillerists who rendered
me such effective service.</p>

<p>During the forenoon a brigade, under command of Colonel &mdash;&mdash;,
reported to me for duty, and was placed near the
artillery in this second line of earthworks (which had been
constructed to fall back upon in case of disaster to our first
line). My dispositions were soon made to attack the enemy
simultaneously at all points&mdash;Cowand and Archer on the
right, Cook and Battle on the left, who were to drive them
from the protection of their traverses. Colonel &mdash;&mdash;
commanded in front with a heavy line of skirmishers, connecting
his left with Cook and his right with Cowand. My
four pieces of artillery poured grape and canister into the
enemy, and I gave the signal for the infantry to advance,
when a general charge was made, but through a direct violation
of orders on the part of Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, this attack
only partially succeeded, capturing that portion of the line
alone upon which the skirmishers advanced, Colonel &mdash;&mdash; having
changed the direction of attack, and charged the point
assigned to the skirmishers on the right, thereby leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
space of three hundred yards unassailed. There is no doubt
in my mind that if Colonel &mdash;&mdash; had attacked with vigor
at that time, we could have driven the enemy entirely from
our works. After the lapse of an hour, during which time
the enemy were heavily reenforced, I ordered another attack
from the second line in which Colonel &mdash;&mdash; participated,
but by again diverting the brigade in the direction of Cowand's
Brigade, instead of towards the salient, the enemy were
dislodged from only a small portion of the lines.</p>

<p>Subsequently sixty men of Johnson's North Carolina Brigade,
under command of Captain Plato Durham, recaptured
Fort Mahone, which for an hour had been so covered by our
fire as to forbid its occupants showing themselves. In taking
this fort a large number of prisoners were captured; so many,
in fact, that when I first saw them skulking behind the earthworks
for protection against the fire of their own men, I
feared it was a ruse on the part of the enemy to surprise us.
They had secreted themselves for safety in this work, and we,
in our charge, had taken the only outlet.</p>

<p>After this no general attack was made, though we continued
slowly but gradually to drive them from traverse to traverse.</p>

<p>About nightfall the enemy occupied some two hundred
yards of our breastworks. Through no inefficiency or negligence
on the part of the officers and men were the works
carried, but owing to the weakness of the line, its extreme
length, and the want of sufficient force to defend it, for they
acted most heroically on this trying occasion. Only one unwounded
man (an officer) did I see seeking the rear, and he
one whom I had the previous day ordered under arrest for
trafficking with the enemy (exchanging tobacco for coffee).
Him I hailed and inquired where he was going, when he
recalled his arrest of the previous day, from which I immediately
released him, and sent him back to his command.</p>

<p>I had a verbal conference with General Lee and afterwards
officially reported my inability to hold this point against
any vigorous attack. In consequence of this report, Lieutenant-Colonel
Peyton, the Army-Inspector, was sent to examine
this line, and he coincided with my views and so
reported to General Lee. On an average throughout, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
space from man to man was at least eight feet in the line
of trenches. I doubted not that with a reserve of five hundred
men I could have driven the enemy from any point which
they might capture, and repeatedly urged that such an arrangement
be made, knowing well that the enemy, by concentrating
a large force on any given point, could press their
way through the line, and my only salvation was in having
the means at hand to drive them back before large numbers
could enter. Our left was the post of greatest danger. There
should the reserve have been placed; but General Lee informed
me that every available man was on duty, and I must
do the best I could.</p>

<p>On Sunday night of the 2nd we had orders to abandon the
works, and without the knowledge of the Federals, we withdrew
to the north side of the Appomattox river, following the
Hickory Road to Goode's Bridge, where we recrossed the Appomattox,
proceeding towards Amelia Court House, which
we reached on the morning of the 5th. Wednesday we remained
stationary in line of battle, confronting the enemy
until about dark, when we followed the army, taking up the
rear, being very much impeded on the march by the wagon
train and its most miserable management, which, as I apprehended,
would cause us some disaster. The enemy showed
themselves on Thursday, about 8 o'clock <small>A. M.</small>, in our rear
and on our left flank, when near Amelia Springs, and in a
short time began to press us vigorously.</p>

<p>I then formed Cox's and Cowand's Brigades in line of
battle, with a heavy skirmish line in front to impede their
progress, and to cover our rear, sending Battle's, Cook's and
Archer's Brigades forward for one-half mile to form there,
across the road, in line of battle in order to allow Cowand
and Cox to retreat safely when the enemy had deployed and
prepared to attack; our right flank being protected by a North
Carolina brigade of cavalry under General Roberts. In this
manner alternating the brigades throughout the day, we continued
to oppose the enemy and retreat, endeavoring to protect
the lagging wagon train, which was successfully done
up to about 4 <small>P. M.</small>, when we approached Sailor's Creek, and
upon the ridge running parallel with that stream we made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
final stand of the day, the wagons becoming blocked up at the
bridge crossing the stream. At this point General Lee ordered
me if possible to hold this line until he could have
artillery put in position on the opposite hills over the creek
parallel with those I occupied.</p>

<p>The enemy pushed on rapidly, attacking us with very great
pertinacity. We here repeatedly repulsed their assaults, but by
turning both of our flanks they succeeded in not only dislodging
but driving us across the creek in confusion. About now
the artillery from the heights occupied by General Lee opened
upon the enemy, and the sun being down they did not cross
the creek. After we broke, personally I was so pressed, the
space between the two wings of the enemy being not over
two hundred yards, that I sought safety in retreat. I galloped
to the creek (the bridge being in their possession) where
the banks were very precipitous, and for protection from their
murderous fire, concluded to jump my horse in, riding him
through the water, and effect my escape by abandoning him on
the other side, the bullets of the enemy whistled around me
like hail all the while. By great good fortune, the opposite
banks proving not so precipitous, and my horse, seeming to
appreciate the situation, clambered up the height and started
off in a run, thus securing my safety. This same animal,
Warren, I still own and treasure for his past services. That
night we took the road for Farmville, crossing the Appomattox
at High Bridge, posting guards on the south side, thus
collecting all stragglers and returning them to their commands.</p>

<p>The next morning (Friday) we continued our march down
the railroad and formed line of battle on the Lynchburg road,
still endeavoring to preserve that "<em>impedimenta</em>" of Cæsar's&mdash;the
wagon-train&mdash;marching by the left flank through the
woods parallel to the road traveled by the wagon train, and
about one hundred or so yards distant from the road. Upon
reaching the road and point that turns towards Lynchburg
from the Cumberland road, three of my brigades, Cook's,
Cox's, and Cowand's, had crossed the Cumberland road and
were in line of battle, and at right angles with Battle's and
Archer's Brigades, who were still parallel with the Cumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
road. Heavy firing was going on at this point, when
General Mahone came rushing up and reported that the
enemy had charged; turning his flank, and driving his men
from their guns and the works which he had erected early in
the day for the protection of these cross roads. I then
ordered my three brigades, Cook's, Cox's, and Cowand's [to
move], at a double-quick on the line with Battle and Archer,
and charging the enemy, we drove them well off from Mahone's
works, recapturing the artillery taken by them and
capturing a large number of prisoners. I held this position
until sent for by General Lee, who complimented the troops
of the division upon the charge made and the service rendered,
ordering me to leave a skirmish line in my front, and
stating that Field's Division would occupy my position; I was
to hurry with all possible dispatch to the road which intersected
the Lynchburg road, as the enemy's cavalry were reported
to be approaching by that road.</p>

<p>We reached this road, halting and keeping the enemy in
check until the wagons had passed, and then continued the
march parallel with the road traveled by the wagon train,
continuing thus to march until night, when we took the road
following to protect the trains.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the 8th, no enemy appeared, and we marched
undisturbed all day. Up to this time, since the evacuation of
Petersburg, we had marched day and night, continually
followed and harassed by the enemy. The men were very
much jaded and suffering for necessary sustenance, our halts
not having been sufficiently long to prepare their food, besides
all our cooking utensils not captured or abandoned were where
we could not reach them. This day Bushrod Johnson's Division
was assigned to and placed under my command, by order
of General Lee. Upon passing a clear stream of water and
learning that the other division of the corps had gone into
camp some two miles ahead, I concluded to halt and give my
broken-down men an opportunity to close up and rejoin us,
and sent a message to General Gordon, commanding the corps,
making known my whereabouts, informing him I would be
at any point he might designate at any hour desired.</p>

<p>By dark my men were all quiet and asleep. About 9<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
o'clock I heard the roar of artillery in our front, and in consequence
of information received, I had my command aroused
in time and passed through the town of Appomattox Court
House before daylight, where, upon the opposite side of the
town, I found the enemy in my front. Throwing out my
skirmishers and forming line of battle, I reconnoitred and
satisfied myself as to their position, and awaited the arrival of
General Gordon for instructions, who, awhile before day,
accompanied by General Fitz Lee, came to my position, when
we held a council of war. General Gordon was of the opinion
that the troops in our front were cavalry, and that General
Fitz Lee should attack. Fitz Lee thought they were infantry
and that General Gordon should attack. They discussed the
matter so long that I became impatient, and said it was somebody's
duty to attack, and that immediately, and I felt satisfied
that they could be driven from the cross-roads occupied
by them, which was the route it was desirable that our wagon
train should pursue, and that I would undertake it; whereupon
Gordon said, "Well, drive them off." I replied, "I
cannot do it with my division alone, but require assistance."
He then said, "You can take the two other divisions of the
corps." By this time it was becoming sufficiently light to
make the surrounding localities visible. I then rode down
and invited General Walker, who commanded a division on
my left, composed principally of Virginians, to ride with me,
showing him the position of the enemy and explaining to him
my views and plan of attack. He agreed with me as to its
advisability. I did this because I felt that I had assumed a
very great responsibility when I took upon myself the charge
of making the attack. I then made dispositions to dislodge
the Federals from their position, placing Bushrod Johnson's
Division upon my right, with instructions to attack and take
the enemy in the flank, while my division skirmishers charged
in front, where temporary earthworks had been thrown up by
the enemy, their cavalry holding the crossings of the road
with a battery. I soon perceived a disposition on their part
to attack this division in flank. I rode back and threw our
right so as to take advantage of some ditches and fences to
obstruct the cavalry if they should attempt to make a charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
In the meantime the cavalry of Fitz Lee were proceeding by
a circuitous route to get in rear of them at these cross-roads.
The enemy observing me placing these troops in position
fired upon me with four pieces of artillery. I remember well
the appearance of the shell, and how directly they came
towards me, exploding and completely enveloping me in
smoke. I then gave the signal to advance, at the same time
Fitz Lee charged those posted at the cross-roads, when my
skirmishers attacked the breastworks, which were taken without
much loss on my part, also capturing several pieces of
artillery and a large number of prisoners, I at the same time
moving the division up to the support of the skirmishers in
echelon by brigades, driving the enemy in confusion for three-quarters
of a mile beyond the range of hills covered with oak
undergrowth. I then learned from the prisoners that my
right flank was threatened. Halting my troops I placed the
skirmishers, commanded by Colonel J. R. Winston, Forty-fifth
North Carolina troops, in front, about one hundred
yards distant, to give notice of indication of attack. I placed
Cox's Brigade, which occupied the right of the division at
right angles to the other troops, to watch that flank. The
other divisions of the corps (Walker's and Evans') were on
the left. I then sent an officer to General Gordon announcing
our success, and that the Lynchburg road was open for
the escape of the wagons, and that I awaited orders. Thereupon
I received an order to withdraw, which I declined to
do, supposing that General Gordon did not understand the
commanding position which my troops occupied. He continued
to send me order after order to the same effect, which
I still disregarded, being under the impression that he did
not comprehend our favorable location, until finally, I received
a message from him, with an additional one as coming
from General Lee, to fall back. I felt the difficulty of withdrawing
without disaster and ordered Colonel J. R. Winston,
commanding the skirmish line which had been posted in my
front on first reaching these hills, to conform his movement
to those of the division, and to move by the left flank so as to
give notice of an attack from that quarter. I then ordered
Cox to maintain his position in line of battle, and not to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
himself until our rear was one hundred yards distant, and
then to fall back in line of battle, so as to protect our rear
and right flank from assault. I then instructed Major Peyton,
of my staff, to start the left in motion, and I continued
with the rear.</p>

<p>The enemy upon seeing us move off, rushed out from under
cover with a cheer, when Cox's Brigade, lying concealed at
the brow of the hill, rose and fired a volley into them which
drove them back into the woods, the brigade then following
their retreating comrades in line of battle unmolested. After
proceeding about half the distance to the position occupied
by us in the morning, a dense mass of the enemy in column
(infantry) appeared on our right, and advanced, without firing,
towards the earthworks captured by us in the early morning,
when a battery of our artillery opened with grape and
canister and drove them under the shelter of the woods.</p>

<p>As my troops approached their position of the morning, I
rode up to General Gordon and asked where I should form
line of battle. He replied, "Anywhere you choose." Struck
by the strangeness of the reply, I asked an explanation, whereupon
he informed me that we would be surrendered. I then
expressed very forcibly my dissent to being surrendered, and
indignantly upbraided him for not giving me notice of such
intention, as I could have escaped with my division and joined
General Joe Johnston, then in North Carolina. Furthermore,
that I should then inform my men of the purpose to
surrender, and that whoever desired to escape that calamity
could go with me, and galloped off to carry this idea into
effect. Before reaching my troops, however, General Gordon
overtook me, and placing his hand upon my shoulder,
asked me if I were going to desert the army and tarnish my
own honor as a soldier and said that it would be a reflection
upon General Lee and an indelible disgrace to me, if I, an
officer of rank, should escape under a flag of truce, which was
then pending. I was in a dilemma and knew not what to do,
but finally concluded to say nothing on the subject to my
troops.</p>

<p>Upon reaching them, one of the soldiers asked if General
Lee had surrendered, and upon my answering that I feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
it was a fact that we had been surrendered, he cast away
his musket and holding his hands aloft cried in an agonized
voice, "Blow, Gabriel, blow! My God, let him blow, I am
ready to die!" We then went beyond the creek at Appomattox
Court House, stacked arms amid the bitter tears
of bronzed veterans, regretting the necessity of capitulation.</p>

<p>Among the incidents ever fresh in my memory of this fatal
day to the Confederacy is the remark of a private soldier.
When riding up to my old regiment to shake by the hand each
comrade who had followed me through four years of suffering,
toil, and privation often worse than death, to bid them a
final affectionate, and, in many instances, an eternal farewell,
a cadaverous, ragged, barefooted man grasped me by the
hand, and choking with sobs said, "Good-bye, General; God
bless you; we will go home, make three more crops and then
try them again." I mention this instance simply to show
the spirit, the pluck, and the faith of our men in the justice
of our cause, and that they surrendered more to grim famine
than to the prowess of our enemies.</p>

<p>That day and the next the terms of surrender were adjusted;
the following day our paroles were signed and countersigned,
and on Wednesday, April 12, 1865, we stacked
our arms in an old field, and each man sought his home as
best he might.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing account of the surrender at Appomattox
was written to Major John W. Moore, at his request, November 5, 1879.</p>

<p>It was fit that North Carolina soldiers should have made
the last charge; they were first at Bethel. The fight was between
the mercantile civilization of the North, Europeanized
by immigration and commerce, and the agricultural civilization
of the South, Americanized by the necessity of its situation.
Being most essentially an agricultural State, least contaminated
by communion with the great cities, and least corrupted
by the greed of trade and the favoritism of trade's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
ill-gotten legislation, North Carolina was the centre of the
rebellion against the aggressions of the North, aggressions
which furthered the European policy of consolidating our
government and destroying the equality, first of the States,
and then of individuals. Democracy is not now a menace
to kingcraft across the Atlantic. Europe has won its fight.
Its policy is now to secure the fruits of its victory by treaties
and alliances.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that North Carolina resorted to arms with
such decent caution and fought with such desperate valor&mdash;the
stakes were great&mdash;she knew the meaning of the fight.
If the South's statesmen had been equal to her warriors there
would have been no war, because she would have been prepared
for it&mdash;every State would have had a place to manufacture
the best ships and arms. Her statesmen were great constitutional
lawyers&mdash;but great lawyers and orators are not necessarily
statesmen.</p>

<p>General Cox's account of "the last charge" differs in
some particulars from that of General Grimes. Both statements
appear together in Moore's <cite>History of North Carolina</cite>,
to which the interested reader may refer.</p>

<small>BY A. C. AVERY</small>.</h2>
</div>

<p>Daniel Harvey Hill was born in the York District in the
State of South Carolina on the 21st of July, 1821. He traced
his descent neither from the Cavaliers of England nor from
the Huguenots of France, but from the sturdy sons of liberty-loving
Scotland, who migrated to the north of Ireland and
ultimately planted colonies in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and
North and South Carolina, where they educated, elevated,
and dominated the people with whom they came in contact.
His paternal grandfather, William Hill, a native of Ireland,
had landed in Pennsylvania, and moving south with the
stream of Scotch-Irish that populated the valley of Virginia
and Western North Carolina, built, with Colonel Hayne as his
partner, in 1770, an iron foundry in York District, which,
within the next decade, was the only point south of Virginia
where cannons were cast for the use of the colonial armies.
He was colonel of a regiment in Sumter's Brigade, and
fought gallantly under him in many engagements. While
Colonel Hill was confined to his home by a wound received in
battle a detachment was sent from the British force at Charleston
to destroy his foundry, and he barely escaped with his life
by hiding under a large log and covering himself with leaves.
When the battle of King's Mountain was fought Colonel
Hill's command had been disbanded, but he went to the field
as a volunteer, and was honored by being invited to the
council held by Campbell, Sevier, McDowell, and other distinguished
regimental commanders, to determine the plan of
attack. He made a number of suggestions that were adopted,
which proved the value of his opinion as a soldier. For
twenty years after the war Colonel Hill was the trusted representative
of his district in the State Senate of South Carolina,
and was the intimate friend of Patrick Calhoun, the
father of the great statesman and orator, John C. Calhoun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
General Hill's mother was Nancy Cabeen, the daughter of
Thomas Cabeen, a native Scotchman, who was Sumter's
trusted scout, and himself "the bravest man in his command,"
as the General himself often declared. Two uncles of General
Hill were soldiers in the second war with England, and
one of them was the adjutant of Colonel Arthur P. Hayne's
Regiment. Solomon Hill, his father, died when his son Harvey
was but four years old, leaving him, with four other children,
to be reared by a mother who was noted for her piety,
culture, common sense, and devotion. Like all Scotch and
Scotch-Irish Presbyterians of the old school, she exacted of
her sons the most rigid observance of the Sabbath. Dr.
John Hill, a somewhat wayward brother of General Hill,
often declared, after he had reached middle age, that during
his boyhood he always "took the blues on Thursday morning
because Sunday was coming." The boys were required,
each in his turn, to select and read a morning prayer when
the family assembled for breakfast. Some of General Hill's
heartiest laughs were provoked by the recollection of the
ludicrous mistakes made by his little brother in his efforts
to find and read the shortest petition in the book, without
regard to its fitness for the occasion.</p>

<p>Sprung from a race of soldiers by the paternal as well as
the maternal line, it is not strange that the earliest ambition
of D. H. Hill led him to seek a place at West Point and
to look forward to a military career. Under the rigid physical
examination now prescribed for an applicant, he would
have been rejected without hesitation. He entered the institution
in 1838, and but for feeble health would have pressed
to the very front of a class of which Generals Longstreet,
A. P. Stewart, G. W. Smith, R. H. Anderson, and Van Dorn
of the Confederate, and Rosecrans, Pope, Sykes, Doubleday,
Stone, and Reynolds of the Federal army were members.</p>

<p>Graduating in 1842, he was still a second lieutenant when
he was ordered with his command into active service in
Mexico in August, 1845. During the three succeeding years
he participated in nearly every battle fought by our forces
under the command of either Scott or Taylor, and always
attracted the notice of his superior officers by his conspicuous
courage. He soon rose to the rank of first lieutenant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
and, for gallant conduct at Contreras and Churubusco, was
breveted captain. At Chapultepec he volunteered with the
storming party, and so distinguished himself among the
scores of brave men who participated with him in that desperate
assault as to win for himself a second brevet as major.
He was one of the six officers in the whole force employed
in Mexico who were twice breveted for meritorious service
upon the field. Animosity, envy, and a disposition to indulge
in carping criticism have led to many unjust reflections upon
General Hill, but the most unscrupulous of his detractors
never questioned his courage or his integrity. When the
Legislature of his native State provided by law that three
swords should be awarded to the three bravest of her soldiers
who had survived the war with Mexico, many letters and
testimonials from the officers of the old army were voluntarily
sent to the Chief Executive, naming D. H. Hill as
among the bravest soldiers in the army of the United States.
Among a few of these testimonials still extant is the letter
from the gallant Bee, who, in exclaiming, a moment before he
fell at Manassas, "There stands Jackson like a stone wall,"
gave to the great leader the pet name by which his soldiers
called him and the world knows him, and thereby made himself
immortal as its author. The letter addressed to General
Dunavant on the 26th of October, 1856, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to add my mite of praise to that which
has already been given to Mr. Hill by his military superiors. I had
the pleasure of knowing him intimately and serving with him in
the storming party detailed from Twiggs' Division for the attack
on Chapultepec. I can bear full testimony to his gallantry and to
his ardent desire to do his duty well. In addition, I can testify
to his State pride, evinced in his going up under a heavy fire to
congratulate and praise a member of the Palmetto regiment who
was behaving under fire most gallantly. For his services on that
day he received honorable mention from his immediate commanders
and also from Colonel Magruder, commanding a light battery,
which battery Lieutenant Hill offered to support when it was
menaced by a body of Mexican lancers. He received the brevet
appointment of major, and was considered a loss to the service
when he resigned.</p>

<p>
Your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
BERNARD BEE,<br />
<i>Captain U. S. Army.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>From the scores of her surviving heroes of the Palmetto
regiment and in the regular army the committee appointed
by the State authorities selected Hill to receive one of the
three swords awarded, and it is still preserved by his family.</p>

<p>After the close of the late war a Federal officer wrote to
General Joseph E. Johnston, asking the name of a Confederate
officer who, on the right of our army at Seven Pines,
had made himself most conspicuous for his daring and indifference
to danger. The only mark of distinction which he
could give General Johnston was that he thought the officer
rode a white horse. General Johnston replied that he supposed
the officer referred to must have been General D. H.
Hill. In writing to General Hill about the matter, General
Johnston said: "I drew my conclusion that your horse might
very well have been taken for white and that no man was
more likely to expose himself than you. Do you know that
in Mexico the young officers called you the bravest man in
the army?"</p>

<p>When the war with Mexico ended Major Hill resigned
his place in the army to accept the professorship of Mathematics
in Washington College at Lexington, Virginia. Before
assuming the duties of that place he was happily married,
November 2d, 1852, to Isabella, oldest daughter of Rev. Dr.
R. H. Morrison, and granddaughter of General Joseph Graham,
who was a distinguished soldier of the Revolution and
the father of Governor William A. Graham. Six years later,
he was invited to take the same professorship at Davidson
College, where for five years he was looked upon as the leading
spirit amongst a corps of able and learned professors.</p>

<p>D. H. Hill was not a politician in the sense of aspiring to
office or attempting to mould public opinion; but when he
saw that the leaders of the North had determined that no
Southerner should be allowed to take his slaves to the territory
wrested from Mexico by the blood and treasure of the
South as well as of the North, he believed that the irrepressible
conflict, which Seward declared at a later day was being
waged, had then begun, and would be settled only upon the
bloody field of battle and after a prolonged, sanguinary, and
doubtful struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>Fully persuaded that the inevitable conflict was near at
hand, and that it was his solemn duty to prepare the rising
generation of his adopted State to meet it he, in 1859, gave
up his pleasant home and his congenial duties at Davidson
College for those of commandant and manager of the Military
Institute at Charlotte.</p>

<p>He harbored no unkind thought against the noble men and
women of the North who held opinions different from his
own. He respected even the honest fanatic, who fairly and
openly contended for his convictions; but he hated cant and
hypocrisy, despised duplicity and dishonesty, and leveled at
them his most effective weapons, ridicule, and sarcasm. For
that portion of our Northern brethren who came to the South
to drive hard bargains with our people and cheat them by
false pretenses, he felt and expressed the most sovereign contempt.
For the men of the North who coveted the wealth
of the Southern planter, and the women who envied their
Southern sisters because of the ease and leisure incident to
the ownership of slaves, he made no attempt to conceal his
hatred and disgust.</p>

<p>Major Hill brought with him to Raleigh his three professors,
Lee, Lane, and McKinney, two of whom fell later at
the head of North Carolina regiments, and one of whom was
the successor of the noble Branch as commander of one
of our best and bravest brigades. He also brought with him
almost the whole corps of cadets, whose services proved invaluable
as drill-masters of the ten thousand volunteers then in
the camp of instruction of which Hill took charge. For his
services in the camp of instruction General Hill was allowed
to select twelve companies to compose the first regiment of
volunteers. The officers of these companies were all leading
and influential citizens, and the rank and file were among
the first young men in the State in intelligence, wealth, and
social position. The service of six months proved a training-school
for that splendid body of volunteers that ultimately
placed them at the head of companies, regiments,
brigades, and divisions. Among its original officers were
Major-General Hoke, Brigadier-Generals Lane and Lewis,
Colonels Avery, Bridgers, Hardy, W. W. McDowell, J. C. S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
McDowell, Starr, Pemberton, Fuller, and a score of others,
while a number from the rank and file fell at the head of
both companies and regiments at later stages of the struggle.</p>

<p>In the outset of this discussion of the career of D. H. Hill
as a Confederate soldier, I lay down and propose to maintain
the proposition that from the time when he fought the first
fight of the war with North Carolina soldiers on Virginia
soil till the day he led the last attacking column of Confederates
east of the Mississippi and checked Sherman's advance
at Bentonsville, whatever may have been the general result
of any engagement, the command of General D. H. Hill was
never found when the firing ceased at night in the rear of
the position it occupied when the signal of attack sounded
in the morning. Apparently reckless in the exposure of his
own person, no officer in our armies was more anxious about
the health, happiness, and safety of his soldiers. His theory
was that spades were instruments of defensive, bayonets of
offensive, warfare, and whether the emergency demanded the
use of the one or the other, it was to be done with "might and
main." When his cadets had asked him whether they should
join South Carolina regiments before their own State seceded
he prophesied that the war would soon begin and would
continue long enough to give every Southerner an opportunity
to display his manhood. He rested his hope of success
upon the belief that every son of the South would rush
to the rescue; that our armies would be supplied by the
labor of our slaves, and that we would thus be enabled to
throw a force into the field sufficient to meet every Northern
man who would tender his services to the Federal Government.
Two important elements were wanting as a basis of
his calculations&mdash;the Southern loyalist and the foreign substitute.
When, therefore, General D. H. Hill reported to
Colonel J. B. Magruder, then in charge of the Peninsula,
and was assigned to the command of the defenses of Yorktown,
he realized, in a measure at least, the magnitude of coming
contest.</p>

<p>It has been said that a man who is himself born to command
is quick to perceive in others the qualities that fit
them for leadership. Colonel Hill seemed almost intuitively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
to descry in the ranks the coolness, courage, judgment, and
power of prompt decision which others recognized in his
favorites after they had led brigades and divisions to victory.
On assuming command at Yorktown he soon discovered that
the cavalry, which he looked upon as the "eye and the ear
of the army," was inefficient, because the force was composed
of a number of detached companies without a trained or efficient
commander. In this emergency an officer of the old
army, who had been commissioned lieutenant in the regular
army of the Confederate States, reported for duty. Marking
him as a man of promise, Colonel Hill at once caused an
order to be issued placing Major John B. Hood in command
of all the cavalry, and waited for the War Department
to ratify the promotion and thus protect him in practicing a
pardonable ruse on the volunteers. That officer ultimately
succeeded Lieutenant-General D. H. Hill as the commander
of a corps, and was still later placed in charge of the army of
Tennessee. The Providence that has provided homes for
his orphan children will in its own good time bring to light
all the facts, and then John B. Hood will stand vindicated
before the world as one of the best and bravest of all our
leaders. It was this same gift that enabled General Hill to
select from the lieutenants of his regiment Robert F. Hoke
to be made a major of his regiment over ten competent captains.
It was this intuitive perception of persistent pluck,
dash, and coolness that prompted him to love and honor
George B. Anderson, William R. Cox, Bryan Grimes, Stephen
D. Ramseur, and Robert D. Johnston, and led him later to
urge the advancement of Gordon, Colquitt, and Doles, of
Georgia. In June, 1861 (a few days after the fight at
Bethel), in a letter to his wife he said of Stonewall Jackson,
then a colonel in command of a brigade, "I see that Jackson
has had an engagement and taken many prisoners. I have
predicted all along that Colonel Jackson would have a prominent
place in the war."</p>

<p>On the 6th of June, 1861, Colonel Hill, then at Yorktown,
was ordered to make a reconnaissance in force in the direction
of Fortress Monroe, and he moved down with his own
regiment and four companies of Richmond Howitzers under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
the command of Major G. W. Randolph (afterwards Secretary
of War), to Little Bethel Church. Receiving information
that Butler's forces were preparing to move up the Peninsula,
Colonel Hill fell back to Big Bethel Church, where,
with a small branch of Black river on his front and right
flank and an almost impenetrable forest on his left, he used
twenty-five spades and several hundred bayonets during the
night in making an enclosed work. Ben. Butler had started
five thousand men in three columns, with the confident expectation
that two of the detachments would travel by roads
passing north and south of the position at Little Bethel and
form a junction two or three miles in the rear of it, where the
roads traveled by these two detachments came together, while
Duryea's Regiment of Zouaves would engage Hill in front
till the other columns should unite and then press him in the
rear in his expected retreat. Two of the detachments mistook
each other in the night and engaged in a skirmish. The
Zouaves, instead of following immediately upon the heels of
the fugitive rebels, as contemplated by Butler, turned back
and fled precipitately on hearing the firing in front of their
own reserve line.</p>

<p>On the next day they again moved forward and attacked
the force at Big Bethel, Colonel Magruder having meantime
arrived with Cary's battalion of infantry. The whole force
engaged on the Confederate side was eight hundred North
Carolinians and four hundred Virginians; on the Federal side,
thirty-five hundred, with from fifteen hundred to twenty-five
hundred in reserve. After preliminary skirmishing for about
two hours, and an attack that lasted two and a half hours
longer, the enemy retreated in great confusion, with a loss of
probably fifty killed and three hundred wounded, and were
so hotly pursued by our cavalry that they scattered guns,
haversacks and knapsacks till they crossed a bridge and
stopped the pursuit by destroying it. The names of no soldiers
of North Carolina should be inscribed in a more prominent
place on the monument to be erected to her heroic dead
than those of Henry L. Wyatt, the first offering of the South
to the Lost Cause, and his three comrades, who rushed forward
in a hail of shot and shell to destroy a house where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
sharpshooters of the enemy had taken shelter. Judging of
its importance by the numbers engaged and the losses on both
sides, the battle of Bethel scarcely rose above the dignity of a
skirmish; yet few events in the early history of the war had
a more important influence upon the contests of the following
year. The splendid bearing of our soldiers sent a thrill of
pride to every Southern heart, and when the first battle of
Manassas was fought, less than a month later, our soldiers
moved forward in the confidence that Southern pluck would
again prevail over a foe that had shown so little dash and
confidence in this encounter.</p>

<p>There was on the Federal side at least one stout leader
who displayed the spirit of a hero. When Major Theodore
Winthrop fell within fifteen feet of our line, bravely leading
a regiment in the charge, even a generous foe felt that he
was worthy to bear the name of the two Winthrops by whose
courage and judgment Americans had first gained a foothold
in this country.</p>

<p>To know D. H. Hill as the soldier of iron nerve, who rode
unmoved in showers of shot and shell, or rebuked in scathing
terms a laggard or a deserter, was to understand nothing of
his true nature. When the battle of Bethel was over and
others were feasting or carousing, Hill had fallen upon his
knees and was returning thanks to Almighty God, Who, he
believed, directed the course of every deadly missile hurled
by the enemy with the same unerring certainty that ordered
the movements of the multitudes of worlds in the universe,
and into whose keeping he daily committed himself, his wife,
and little ones, his staff and his soldiers with the calm reliance
of a child, that as a kind father He would provide what
was best for him and them.</p>

<p>On the day after the fight at Bethel he wrote his wife:
"I have to thank God for a great and decided victory, and
that I escaped with a slight contusion on the knee.... It
is a little singular that my first battle in this war should be
at Bethel, where I was baptized and worshiped till I was
sixteen years old&mdash;the church of my mother. Was she not
a guardian spirit in the battle, averting ball and shell? Oh
God, give me gratitude to Thee, and may we never dishonor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
Thee by weak faith!" Still later he wrote his wife: "I look
for a battle about the first of October. Pray for me that I
may be well. (He was then in delicate health).... We are
in the hands of God, and as safe on the battle-field as anywhere
else. We will be exposed to a heavy fire, but the arm
of God is mightier than the artillery of the enemy."</p>

<p>After the battle Governor Ellis issued a commission of
brigadier-general to him, as Governor Letcher had done at
an earlier date in the case of Jackson, but President Davis
delayed giving him the appointment till September, 1861.
The response to a letter from his wife, written during this
interval, in which she complained of the delay, shows how
little the outer world understood his character or his motives:
"You must not be concerned about my commission," he
wrote. "I feel too distrustful of my own skill, coolness, and
judgment. I have never coveted, and always avoided, positions
of trust and responsibility. The offices that I have held
have not been of my seeking."</p>

<p>Upon receiving his commission as a brigadier in September,
1861, the first work assigned to him was the command
of the coast of North Carolina, with the duty, as far as possible,
of constructing fortifications wherever necessary. Hopeless
as was the task assigned, he brought all of his energies
to bear upon it, and during the few months that he remained
in North Carolina did so much to strengthen our forts and
improve the discipline and spirit of the troops that the public
men of the State asked for his return in every time of peril,
until it became the custom of the general commanding to
send him to his department south of the James when all was
quiet on the Potomac, and recall him to the command of his
division in the field when active operations were resumed.</p>

<p>His first connection with the Army of Northern Virginia
was when, early in December, 1861, he was ordered to report
to General Johnston at Manassas, and was assigned to command
at Leesburg on the left of the line. While he was stationed
there an incident occurred which evinced the strength
and warmth of General Hill's affection for his early friends,
even in the Federal army. General Stone was in charge
of the force on the opposite side of the river, and after writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
an official letter, sent under a flag of truce, General Hill appended
a postscript to the effect that, if the fortunes of war
should place his old academy chum in his custody he should
feel more inclined to take him into his own tent than to consign
him to prison. This led to the interchange of several
kind messages appended to similar communications. Unfortunately
Stone was a pronounced Democrat, and, like
McClellan, was unwilling to recant or repent. Seizing upon
this excuse, Stanton arrested him on a charge of disloyalty,
and gave him no opportunity to vindicate himself till the
close of the war, when he resigned and spent his last days in
command of the army of the Khedive of Egypt.</p>

<p>On the night of the battle of Gaines' Mill, Major Clitz and
General Reynolds, old army comrades of General Hill, were
brought as prisoners to his quarters. He received both very
kindly and sent for a surgeon to dress Major Clitz's wound,
while he comforted Reynolds, who was mortified at being
caught asleep, by reminding him that his gallant conduct
in Mexico and on the border would protect his good name
from a shade of suspicion. Both were placed in an ambulance,
paroled to report to General Winder at Richmond, and
furnished with the address of a friend of General Hill's who
would honor their drafts for money. These incidents are
reproduced because they bring to view traits of General Hill's
character of which the world generally knows so little, his
warm sympathy for suffering and his lasting and unswerving
fidelity to his friends.</p>

<p>From the moment when Johnston placed Hill, then a
major-general, at the head of a division in March, 1862, till
the last shock of arms at Bentonsville, Hill's position on
every march and in every battle, with scarcely a single exception,
was the post of danger and honor. His was the first
division of Johnston's army to enter Yorktown and the last
to leave it and pass with his command through the reserve
line. When the vanguard of the enemy, led by Hancock,
rushed upon our rear at Williamsburg, it was Basil C. Manly,
of Ramseur's Battery, who, seeing that a section of the
enemy's light artillery might beat him in the race to occupy
an earthwork midway between the two, unlimbered on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
way and by a well-directed shot disabled the enemy <em>in
transitu</em>, and as quick as thought limbered up again and ran
into the fortifications. It was the regiment of Duncan K.
MacRae, of D. H. Hill's Division, that extorted from the generous
and gallant Hancock that memorable declaration, "The
Fifth North Carolina and Twenty-fourth Virginia deserve
to have the word <em>immortal</em> inscribed on their banners." It
was this charge which Early describes as "an attack upon the
vastly superior forces of the enemy, which for its gallantry
is unsurpassed in the annals of warfare."</p>

<p>When McClellan moved his army over Bottom's Bridge,
threw a heavy column across the Chickahominy and extended
his line towards the north of Richmond, General R. E. Lee
was then acting as advisory commander of all the armies
of the Confederacy. He concurred with Mr. Davis in the
opinion that McClellan should be attacked on the other side
of the Chickahominy before he matured his preparations for
a siege of Richmond. (<cite>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate
Government</cite>, Vol. I, p. 120.) When General Lee communicated
their views to General Johnston, he told Lee that his
plan was to send A. P. Hill to the right and rear of the
enemy and G. W. Smith to the left flank, with orders to make
simultaneous attacks for the purpose of doubling up the army,
and sending Longstreet to cross at Mechanicsville bridge and
attack him in front. McClellan's line on his right was not
then well fortified, and the general disposition of the Federal
forces was more favorable for a Confederate advance than a
month later, when Lee concentrated a heavy force on the left
and turned it. After McDowell's movement to Hanover
Court House, when his vanguard was checked by Branch,
the blows stricken by Jackson in such rapid succession in the
valley had excited apprehension so grave in the mind of Lincoln
that, despite McClellan's protest, he ordered the withdrawal
of that command to Fredericksburg for the protection
of Washington City. For reasons that were unsatisfactory
to the President, General Johnston, after marching and
countermarching G. W. Smith's and Longstreet's Divisions,
abandoned his first plan of operations and ordered the troops
to assume substantially their original positions. President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
Davis, in his work <cite>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</cite>,
takes the ground that after waiting a week and
giving McClellan the opportunity to fortify, operations should
have been delayed another day till the Chickahominy had
risen high enough to sweep away the bridges and till Huger
had had time to move up his artillery from his position near
Richmond.</p>

<p>The popular impression that the bridges across the Chickahominy
had already been swept away when the fight at
Seven Pines began on the 30th of May, 1861, is totally unfounded.
The corps of Heintzelman and Keyes were then
south and that of Sumner north of the Chickahominy. The
plan outlined by General Johnston was, briefly, that Huger
should move from his camp near Richmond early on that
morning down the Charles City road and vigorously attack the
enemy's right, and that Longstreet and Hill, moving on the
same road, should attack the center and left of the force south
of the bridge, while G. W. Smith's Corps should advance on
the Nine Mile Road and turn the left of Heintzelman and
Keyes, if Sumner should not have arrived, or engage and prevent
the junction of his with the other corps, if he should
cross. Longstreet and Hill were in position to attack at an
early hour, but waited till ten o'clock for the arrival of Huger,
whose division, except two regiments of Rodes' (which created
a diversion by a vigorous attack on the right), did not arrive
in time to participate in the action. Our failure to destroy
an enemy who, by a concerted movement in the forenoon,
would have been utterly routed and driven from the field or
captured was, as is universally conceded, one of the most
palpable blunders of the war, but the question upon whose
shoulders the blame rests still confronts us. No engagement
of the war has given rise to more acrimonious censure and
crimination than Seven Pines. Mr. Davis, General Johnston,
General Longstreet, General Smith, and General Huger
have each in turn discussed the conduct of both the active
and passive leaders of that memorable day.</p>

<p>The future historians who shall make up for posterity their
verdict upon the controverted points of the battle of Seven
Pines will find one fact admitted by all of the disputants:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
that D. H. Hill was the hero of the occasion, and with his
own gallant division, aided by two of Longstreet's brigades,
drove the enemy in confusion from the breastworks and
turned their own guns upon them as they retreated. Longstreet,
who was in command on the right, generously said in
his report: "The conduct of the attack was left entirely to
Major-General Hill. The success of the affair is sufficient
evidence of his ability, courage, and skill." Commenting
upon the language of Longstreet, President Davis said:
"This tribute to General Hill was no more than has been
accorded to him by others who knew of his services on that
day, and was in keeping with the determined courage, vigilance,
and daring exhibited by him on other fields."</p>

<p>General Johnston's language was not less unequivocal in
according to Hill the credit of making a very gallant and
the only successful attack upon the enemy's works, when he
said in his report: "The principal attack was made by Major-General
Longstreet with his own and Major-General D. H.
Hill's Division&mdash;the latter mostly in advance. Hill's brave
troops, admirably commanded and most gallantly led, forced
their way through the abattis which formed the enemy's external
defenses and stormed their entrenchments by a most
determined rush. Such was the manner in which the enemy's
first line was carried. The operation was repented with the
same gallantry and success as our troops pursued their victorious
career through the enemy's successive camps and entrenchments.
At each new position they encountered fresh troops
and reenforcements brought from the rear. Thus they had
to repel repeated efforts to retake works which they had carried,
but their advance was never successfully resisted."</p>

<p>On the 31st of May, 1862, General R. E. Lee was assigned
to the command of the army in place of General Johnston,
who had been painfully wounded on the previous day, and
immediately addressed himself to the arduous task of preparing
for the decisive encounter, which could not be long
delayed. His "exhibition of grand administrative talent
and indomitable energy in bringing up that army in so short
a time to that state of discipline which maintained its aggregation
during those terrible seven days' fight around Richmond,"
says Colonel Chilton, was "his greatest achievement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>The order of battle in the memorable seven days' fight
required A. P. Hill, when Jackson should pass down in rear
of Mechanicsville, to cross at Meadow Bridge and drive the
enemy so as to enable D. H. Hill to pass over the bridge at
that village.</p>

<p>In obedience to messages from General Lee and President
Davis, General Hill, after crossing, went forward with the
brigade of Brigadier-General Ripley to cooperate with the
division of General A. P. Hill. At the request of Brigadier-General
Pender, Hill directed Ripley just at dark to act in
concert with that dashing officer in the effort to turn the
enemy's position at Ellison's Mill and drive him from it.</p>

<p>The desperate charge across an open field in the face of a
murderous fire, in which that brave soldier and noble man,
Colonel Montford S. Stokes of the First North Carolina Regiment,
fell mortally wounded, was neither planned by General
Hill nor executed under his directions. (<cite>Official Records</cite>,
Series 1, Vol. XI, Part 2, p. 623.) The suggestion that General
Hill deliberately and unnecessarily rushed those gallant
men into danger is unfounded and unjust. The galling fire
that had broken Pender's left called for immediate action, and
in the hurry of the moment it became necessary to develop
the strength of the enemy's position by assault instead of reconnaissance,
but it was done under the orders of General Lee
and the President, not of General Hill.</p>

<p>When on the second day Jackson had effected a junction
with Lee, Hill was selected to relieve his tired troops by
passing rapidly to his left and turning the extreme right of
the enemy. A. P. Hill, Longstreet, Whiting, and Jackson
had successively moved upon the double lines of infantry
and artillery posted on the range of hills behind Powhite
Creek from the McGehee to the Gaines house. The approach
of the attacking columns of A. P. Hill and Whiting was in
part over a plain about four hundred yards wide and was embarrassed
by abattis and ditches in front of the first line. The
struggle along the front of these divisions and that of Longstreet
had become doubtful, and almost desperate, when the
troops of Jackson and Hill created a diversion by engaging the
extreme right of the enemy. The first of the lines of entrenchments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
had been taken, and Longstreet, Hood, Law,
and other brave leaders were moving on the last stronghold
in the enemy's center, when the victorious shouts of Garland's
and G. B. Anderson's Brigades of Hill's Division were
followed by the rapid retreat of the enemy and the surrender,
first of the ridge at the McGehee house, and then of their
whole line. Thus did it fall to the lot of Hill once more to
strike the decisive blow at a critical moment. But claiming
for him this distinction among a host of heroic commanders,
it is proper that I should rely on the evidence of the lamented
Garland, who sealed his devotion to the cause with his heart's
blood at South Mountain, and the corroborating accounts of
Hill's superiors, from Jackson to President Davis, and not on
my own assertion.</p>

<p>"The effect of our appearance at this opportune moment
upon the enemy's flank, cheering and charging," said Garland
in his report, "decided the fate of the day. The enemy
broke and retreated and made a second stand, which induced
my immediate command to halt under cover of the roadside
and return the fire, when charging forward again we broke
and scattered them in every direction." This discomfiture
uncovered the left of the fortified line and left no obstacle
between Hill and the McGehee house. (<cite>Official Records</cite>,
Series 1, Vol. XI, Part 2, p. 626.)</p>

<p>General Jackson's language is not less unmistakable:
"Again pressing forward, the Federals fell back, but only
to select a position for more obstinate defense, when at dark&mdash;under
the pressure of our batteries and the dashing charge of
General Hill's infantry, in which the troops of General C. S.
Winder joined&mdash;the enemy yielded the field and fled in confusion."
Of the part taken by Hill, General Lee said in his
report (<cite>Official Records</cite>, Series 1, Vol. XI, Part 2, p. 493):
"D. H. Hill charged across the open ground in his front, one
of his regiments having first bravely carried a battery whose
fire enfiladed his advance. Gallantly supported by the troops
on his right, who pressed forward with unfaltering resolution,
he reached the crest of the ridge (above the McGehee house),
and after a sanguinary struggle broke the enemy's line, captured
several of his batteries and drove him in confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
towards the Chickahominy until darkness rendered further
pursuit impossible." Mr. Davis, in <cite>The Rise and Fall of the
Confederate Government</cite>, Vol. II, p. 138, adopts the exact
language of General Lee. General McClellan refers to the
report of Fitz John Porter, who was in command, for a
detailed account of the affair at Gaines' Mill. Porter admits
that the withdrawal of his line was caused by the retreat on
his right, but insists that the demoralization was due entirely
to the stampede of the Federal cavalry, who were mistaken,
as they fell back on the infantry line, for rebels. More candid,
or better informed than General Porter, the French
princes, who served on his staff on that day, admit that the
charge of Hill and the discomfiture of the enemy's right
necessitated the abandonment of their line of entrenchments.
If to double the right flank of an army suddenly back, so
as to expose to an enfilade the flank of his last and strongest
line of entrenchments, is to make his position untenable,
then Hill's charge was indeed decisive of the struggle
at Gaines' Mill.</p>

<p>Crossing the Chickahominy on the night of the 29th, in
the advance of Jackson's Corps, D. H. Hill passed Savage
Station, where he took one thousand prisoners, exclusive of
three thousand in and connected with the Federal Hospital.
The progress of Jackson was arrested by obstructions and the
stubborn resistance at White Oak Swamp, and he failed to
effect a junction with Longstreet till after the fight at Frasier's
Farm.</p>

<p>D. H. Hill was again the first to reach and occupy the
position which he was ordered to assume preparatory to a
general advance on Malvern Hill. The other parts of the
line were not formed till a much later hour in the day.
General Lee says in his report, of the battle (<cite>Official Records</cite>,
Series 1, Vol. XI, Part 2, p, 496): "Orders were issued for
a general advance at a given signal, but the causes referred to
prevented a proper concert of action among the troops. D.
H. Hill pressed forward across the open field and engaged the
enemy gallantly, breaking and driving back his first line;
but a simultaneous advance of the other troops not taking
place, he found himself unable to maintain the ground he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
gained against the overwhelming numbers and numerous batteries
of the enemy. Hill was therefore compelled to abandon
a part of the ground he had gained after suffering severe
loss and inflicting heavy damage upon the enemy."</p>

<p>Prompt, vigilant, and obedient, he was always at his post
at the appointed hour, and with the true conception of soldierly
duty, moved upon order or signal of his superiors without
waiting to count the cost. At Malvern Hill, as at Seven
Pines, he charged the enemy under orders from the commanding
general. The persistent pluck of his brave men,
developed to the highest degree of his own unequaled coolness
and courage, enabled him again to take and hold much
of the enemy's outer line till after the last gun was fired.</p>

<p>When Pope had twice been punished by Jackson and
driven back upon the supposed stronghold at Manassas, the
transfer of troops from the Federal army on the Peninsula
made it necessary for General Lee to move with the bulk of
his army to the support of his dashing lieutenant, who had
already twice defeated an enemy much stronger numerically
than himself. D. H. Hill, recalled from the command of his
department south of the James, which included his own State,
and placed at the head of his old division, was ordered to
watch and check the movements of McDowell's command,
which was still occupying Fredericksburg, and consequently
took no part in the second battle of Manassas.</p>

<p>Crossing over the Potomac with Longstreet to Fredericktown,
Maryland, when our forces moved from that point
south General Hill was ordered to occupy and hold a pass
in the South Mountains, which, if gained by McClellan,
would have enabled him to relieve Harper's Ferry and possibly
to prevent the junction of our scattered army and destroy
the divisions in detail, or drive them precipitately south of
the Potomac with great loss of artillery and transportation.</p>

<p>General Lee's object in crossing the Potomac east of the
Blue Ridge was to induce the enemy, by threatening Washington
and Baltimore, to evacuate Martinsburg and Harper's
Ferry, and to establish his own line of communication through
the valley, and then by advancing towards Pennsylvania to
draw the enemy away from his own base of supplies. General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
Lee had not contemplated making a stand at South Mountain,
probably not at Sharpsburg, or at any point north of
the Potomac; but the continued occupation of Martinsburg
and Harper's Ferry made it necessary to move directly upon
the former place and to invest the latter, where both garrisons
ultimately united. In consequence of the delay in
reducing the garrison it became essential to the safety of
Lee's army that McClellan's entire force should be held in
check for a whole day at the pass in the South Mountains
by Hill's depleted division, now numbering only four thousand,
as a glance at the map with a knowledge of the disposition
of Lee's different divisions will show.</p>

<p>Longstreet, with his whole force, estimated at four thousand,
was at Hagerstown, while Jackson had disposed his own
command, including McLaws' and A. P. Hill's Divisions,
either with a view to an attack on Harper's Ferry or to cutting
off the retreat of the force occupying it. Three days later
McClellan, according to his own report, advanced to the attack
at Sharpsburg with eighty-seven thousand men. Of this vast
army probably thirty-three thousand were in the force actually
engaged in the assault upon the little Spartan band of D. H.
Hill for five hours, without cessation, before Longstreet's advance
brigade arrived at 3:30 o'clock, which was followed by
others coming up from that time till dark.</p>

<p>The late Justice Ruffin, Colonel of the Thirteenth North
Carolina, standing by the side of the gallant Garland when
he was instantly killed, discovered a moment later that the
other regiments of the brigade had retired, leaving his command
surrounded by the enemy. Facing to the rear in an
instant, he ordered his regiment to charge, and though embarrassed
by a painful wound, performed the desperate feat of
cutting his way through the serried ranks of the enemy. A
few moments later that gallant officer was astonished to hear
his intrepid commander express his delight at the discovery
that McClellan's whole army was approaching his front. The
explanation afterwards given was one that could have been
safely disclosed only to a kindred spirit, such as Ruffin had
shown himself to be. Hill then said that he had at first
feared the movement upon his front was a feint, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
main body of the enemy had passed through another gap and
might be thrown between Jackson and Lee. The situation
was still further embarrassed by the fact that General Stuart
had at daylight withdrawn his command, except the single
regiment of Rosser, which afterwards did its duty so nobly,
under the impression that but a small force was in General
Hill's front.</p>

<p>It was "with the stern joy" of an intrepid warrior waiting
for the coming contest, that from an elevated pinnacle of the
mountain he saw the four advance corps of the grand Army
of the Potomac, one of which was forming at the foot of the
mountain. The hour and the man had met when Lee entrusted
to Hill the duty of holding the approach against that
army with his little band of four thousand. From Seven
Pines to Malvern Hill they had never turned their backs upon
the foe. They believed that their leader would require them
to endure no sacrifice or face no danger that was not demanded
by the inevitable exigencies of the situation. With
God's help, Hill determined to save the army, as his chief
ordered him to do at any sacrifice, and, if the emergency had
demanded his own life, he would have met death, not as the
decree of fate, but as the Providence of God, who had
brought him face to face with a desperate duty. Captain
Seaton Gales, the gallant Adjutant-General of George B.
Anderson on that memorable day, summarized the important
results of this battle as follows:</p>

<p>"It may be safely said that in its consequences, in the
accomplishments of predetermined objects, and in the skillful
disposition of small numbers to oppose overwhelming odds,
it is without a parallel in the war. The division, unaided until
a late hour in the afternoon, held in check the greater portion
of McClellan's vast army endeavoring with battering-ram
impetus to force its way through the narrow gap, and thereby
afforded time for the concentration of our various corps, dispersed
in strategic directions, in season for the bloody issue at
Sharpsburg."</p>

<p>Imbued with an earnest devotion to the cause, which rose
on occasion to the height of enthusiasm, Hill did not hesitate
to denounce in unmeasured terms those who evaded duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
in our armies, when the conditions were such as to plainly
demand the active service of every able-bodied son of the
South. One of his random shots at the "bomb-proofs" of
the Confederacy wounded a gentleman who, having done
nothing in the war worthy to be written, determined to write
something, in the vain hope that it would be read by future
generations. Prompted by petty revenge, he recklessly
asserted that General D. H. Hill had thrown a copy of a
general order upon the ground in his camp at Frederick City,
which being afterwards picked up and handed to McClellan,
gave him an idea of the movements and location of the different
portions of Lee's army.</p>

<p>It will appear from an inspection of its contents that on the
day when McClellan attacked Hill at South Mountain, he had
reason to believe, and must have thought, that Longstreet
was occupying the mountains, supported by Hill. But we are
not left to conjecture on that subject. McClellan wrote General
Franklin from Frederick City on the 14th, just after he
had read the "lost order," that Longstreet was to move to
Boonsborough, and there halt with D. H. Hill, and he therefore
directed Franklin to make his dispositions with an eye
both to the relief of the garrison at Harper's Ferry and the
capture of Longstreet and Hill. The plan outlined in the
letter is predicated upon the supposition that Longstreet and
Hill were together, and constituted the main body of an army,
which he estimated in another report to General Halleck at
one hundred and twenty thousand. If it were not manifest
from this letter that McClellan was misled by the order, and
his opinion corroborated by the skillful disposition of Hill's
troops, his report proves beyond all question that he thought
the force in his front was thirty thousand strong, composed
of Hill's Division, fifteen thousand, with Longstreet's and a
portion of Jackson's command (<cite>Official Records</cite>, Series 1,
Vol. XIX, Part 1, p. 55). The skill of Hill, then, and the
order combined to mislead McClellan by causing him to over-estimate
our strength, and the cautious and dilatory movement
which gave Longstreet time to come up in the afternoon,
enabled Hill to escape with his little band, leaving the
whole Army of the Potomac deployed before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>The order issued by Lee and sent out from army headquarters
was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia</span>,<br />
September 9, 1862.</p>

<p><i>Special Orders No. 191.</i>
</p>

<p>I. The citizens of Fredericktown being unwilling, while overrun
by members of this army, to open their stores, in order to give
them confidence, and to secure to officers and men purchasing supplies
for benefit of this command, all officers and men of this army
are strictly prohibited from visiting Fredericktown except on business,
in which case they will bear evidence of this in writing from
division commanders. The Provost Marshal in Fredericktown will
see that his guard rigidly enforces this order.</p>

<p>II. Major Taylor will proceed to Leesburg, Va., and arrange for
transportation of the sick and those unable to walk to Winchester,
securing the transportation of the country for this purpose. The
route between this and Culpeper Court House east of the mountains
being unsafe, will no longer be traveled. Those on the way
to this army already across the river will move up promptly, all
others will proceed to Winchester collectively and under command
of officers, at which point, being the general depot of the army,
its movements will be known and instructions given by commanding
officers regulating further movements.</p>

<p>III. The army will resume its march to-morrow, taking the
Hagerstown road. General Jackson's command will form the advance,
and, after passing Middletown, with such portion as he may
select, take the route to Sharpsburg, cross the Potomac at the
most convenient point, and by Friday morning take possession of
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, capture such of the enemy as may be
at Martinsburg, and intercept such as may attempt to escape from
Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>IV. General Longstreet's command will pursue the main road as
far as Boonsborough, where it will halt, with reserve, supply and
baggage trains of the army.</p>

<p>V. General McLaws, with his own division and that of General
R. H. Anderson, will follow General Longstreet. On reaching Middletown
will take the route to Harper's Ferry, and by Friday morning
possess himself of the Maryland Heights and endeavor to capture
the enemy at Harper's Ferry and vicinity.</p>

<p>VI. General Walker, with his division, after accomplishing the
object in which he is now engaged, will cross the Potomac at
Cheek's Ford, ascend its right bank to Lovettsville, take possession
of the Loudoun Heights, if practicable, by Friday morning, Key's
Ford on his left, and the road between the end of the mountain
and the Potomac on his right. He will, as far as practicable, co-operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
with Generals McLaws and Jackson and intercept retreat
of the enemy.</p>

<p>VII. General D. H. Hill's Division will form the rear guard of
the army, pursuing the road taken by the main body. The reserve
artillery, ordnance, and supply trains, etc., will precede General
Hill.</p>

<p>VIII. General Stuart will detach a squadron of cavalry to accompany
the commands of Generals Longstreet, Jackson, and McLaws,
and, with the main body of the cavalry, will cover the route of
the army, bringing up all the stragglers that may have been left
behind.</p>

<p>IX. The commands of Generals Jackson, McLaws, and Walker,
after accomplishing the objects for which they have been detached,
will join the main body of the army at Boonsborough or Hagerstown.</p>

<p>X. Each regiment on the march will habitually carry its axes in
the regimental ordnance wagons, for use of the men at their
encampments, to procure wood, etc.</p>

<p>By command of General R. E. Lee.</p>

<p>[The copy of the "lost order" given by McClellan, as far
as it goes, is the same as the one above set forth, but it does
not contain sections 1 and 2.]</p>

<p>If Pollard's malignant charges, made to detract from the
honor and glory of an achievement so brilliantly executed
and so fruitful of benefit to the cause, were not shown by the
most direct proof from the most honorable men to be false
and unfounded, the marked discrepancy between the order
published in the <cite>Official Records</cite>, as No. 191, copied from
General Lee's book of general orders, and that which McClellan
declared in his report to be a <em>copy</em> of the order sent by
him to Washington, suggests to a legal mind a solution of
the dispute which corroborates in the strongest possible manner
the sworn testimony of Major James W. Ratchford,
Adjutant-General of Hill's Division, that the custody of such
papers was a part of his exclusive duty at that time, and
that no such order was delivered to him, with the solemn
statement of General Hill that he never saw or read a copy
of the order in question, except one purporting to have been
sent through General Jackson, to whose corps he was attached
when it was issued, and which he still preserved among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
private papers in 1886. It will be observed that the first of
the two paragraphs, omitted in what purports to be the copy
of the order that fell into the possession of the enemy, forbade
the troops stationed around Frederick City from entering that
town without permission, and the second directed that the
sick and disabled of the army should be removed to Winchester.
Halleck's correspondence with McClellan on the
same day, September 13, 1862 (<cite>Official Records</cite>, Series 1, Vol.
XIX, Part 1, p. 41), evinces the greatest apprehension that
the movement of the army was aimed at Washington City,
and the demonstrations higher up the Potomac were intended
to distract attention from the real design. Was it not
more important that the chief officer of all the armies should
know that Lee's sick and disabled soldiers were to be moved to
Winchester, as the general depot of the army, and that all
recruits, returning or coming for the first time to the army
were to rendezvous at Winchester, than to learn from the
last paragraph of the copy sent him that Lee's troops were to
habitually carry in their regimental wagons axes to cut wood,
etc.? The second paragraph seemed plainly to indicate that
Lee's purpose was what he afterwards declared in his report
to have been his plan&mdash;to establish his base of operations by
way of the valley of Virginia and invade or threaten Pennsylvania,
not Washington, after taking Harper's Ferry. (<cite>Official
Records</cite>, Series 1, Vol. XIX. Part 1, p. 145.) This was
McClellan's own idea of Lee's design, and if he could have
convinced Halleck of the correctness of his views there would
have been no reason for further hesitation about weakening
the garrison of the capital city to swell the effective force in
the field. McClellan did not get the whole order and omit
a portion of it in his correspondence at the time because it
tended to sustain his view against Halleck. He did not send
his chief the full copy of his order and omit in his report,
written after his removal from command, a section which
proved that he (not Halleck) had divined Lee's purpose from
the beginning. The two paragraphs would not have been
omitted in a copy intended for Hill, because it was Hill's
troops that at the time were stationed nearest to Frederick
City, and were prohibited from entering it. It is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
that General Lee must have sent the whole order to Hill, and
it is equally manifest that McClellan had every reason for
inserting a full copy in his report if he received it.</p>

<p>The explanation which readily suggests itself, therefore,
is that the original draft of the order contained only the
portion beginning with the third section and was signed in
that shape by Colonel Chilton, but was afterwards modified
so as to prefix the two first paragraphs before it was issued.
The "lost order" was found by an Indiana soldier, wrapped
around three cigars. The first paper drawn would have become
useless after the material additions made to it, and
might well have been wrapped around cigars by some one at
General Lee's headquarters, with the purpose of using it to
light them, and then lost before cigars or paper were disposed
of, as intended. It will be more readily believed that a
clerk or assistant in the office at army headquarters might have
been guilty of carelessness than that Ratchford swore to and
that Hill told a falsehood. If their positive statements are believed,
only the one order, addressed as though sent through
General Jackson's headquarters, was received by General Hill.
When Lee and Hill were encamped in sight of each other
near Fredericktown, and General Lee was then and afterwards
(as at South Mountain) habitually sending orders direct
to General Hill, it does not seem probable that Lee, whose
forte was the power of readily mobilizing his army, would
have tolerated such circumlocution as making one courier
ride across the Potomac to Jackson with an order which was
to be sent back by another messenger to a camp in sight of
its starting point on the next day. It would have been a fair
compromise between extreme official courtesy and that common
sense which always characterized the conduct of our
great leaders, if Lee had recognized Jackson's authority by
addressing the order as though transmitted through him, and
at the same time ordering its delivery directly to Hill, thus
conforming his conduct to the conditions which demanded
that Hill should know at the earliest possible moment of his
proposed plan of operation, and of the prohibition against
entering the neighboring town applying only to his own and
Longstreet's Division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span></p>

<p>The direct testimony bearing upon the dispute in reference
to the lost order was the sworn statement of Major
James W. Ratchford, Adjutant-General, that only the single
copy of the order reached him, which was preserved by General
Hill till his death, and the solemn statement of Hill that
he himself received no other copy. Leaving out of view
the difference between the original paper recorded in Lee's
book and the supposed copy delivered to McClellan, there is
nothing to contradict the testimony of one of the bravest
and truest officers in the army of Virginia and the word of
D. H. Hill. The attention of these two officers had been
called to the loss of the paper within a few months after it
passed into McClellan's hands, when all that had occurred
in Maryland was still fresh in their memories, and they then
made the same statement that the one reiterates to-day and
the other published in 1886. Lee himself charged no particular
person with the loss of the dispatch. While he possibly
magnified (says Longstreet in his article in the <cite>Century
Magazine</cite>) its effect upon the Maryland campaign, he was
inclined to attribute its loss to the fault of a courier. (<cite>Battles
and Leaders of the Civil War</cite>, Vol. II, p. 674.) In his
report of the operations in Maryland he said: "The small
command of General Hill repelled repeated assaults of the
Federal army and held it in check for five hours." The only
contradicting testimony comes from Major Taylor of General
Lee's staff, and being negative in its character, is not entitled
to the weight that should be attached to the positive evidence
of gentlemen of equal reputation for veracity. The substance
of his statement is, that it was his habit during that campaign
to send such orders directly to the headquarters of Hill's Division
as well as through Jackson to Hill. But he neither recalls
the fact of sending the particular paper in question, nor does
he name any officer or courier who attests its actual delivery.
Admitting the high character of Taylor, as well as that of
Ratchford, the verdict of history, under the most familiar
rules of evidence, must unquestionably acquit Hill of negligence,
and accord to him the high honor of saving the army
of Lee by his strategy, coolness, and courage.</p>

<p>At Sharpsburg, the last engagement in which D. H. Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
participated with that army, no figure was more conspicuous
and no line firmer than his. As usual, he was the first to
open and the last to quit the fight. General Lee said in his
report: "The attack on our left was speedily followed by one
in heavy force on the center. This was met by part of Walker's
Division and the brigades of G. B. Anderson and Rodes
of D. H. Hill's command, assisted by a few pieces of artillery.
The enemy were repulsed and retired behind the crest of a
hill, from which they kept up a desultory fire. At this time,
by a mistake of orders, General Rodes' Brigade was withdrawn
from its position during the temporary absence of that officer
at another part of the field. The enemy immediately passed
through the gap thus created and G. B. Anderson's Brigade
was broken and retired, General Anderson himself being mortally
wounded.... The heavy masses of the enemy again
moved forward, being opposed by only four pieces of artillery,
supported by a few hundred men belonging to different brigades,
rallied by General D. H. Hill and other officers, and
parts of Walker's and R. H. Anderson's commands, Colonel
Cooke of the Twenty-seventh North Carolina Regiment, of
Walker's Brigade, standing boldly in line without a cartridge."
"At this critical moment, when the enemy was advancing
on Cooke," says General Longstreet, "a shot came
across the Federal front, plowing the ground in a parallel line,
then another and another, each nearer and nearer their line.
This enfilade fire was from a battery on D. H. Hill's line,
and it soon beat back the attacking column." (<cite>Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War</cite>, Vol. II, p. 670.)</p>

<p>On the right General Lee was stationed in person, and with
Toombs' Brigade (says General Longstreet) held the enemy
in check till A. P. Hill's Division rushed to the rescue, with
Pender on the right and Branch on the left of his line, and
aided by well-directed shots from a battery planted by D. H.
Hill on his front, drove them back in confusion. Generals
Lee, Longstreet, and D. H. Hill concluded during a short
suspension of musketry fire to reconnoiter the position of the
enemy from the crest of a ridge in front of the Confederate
line, which was formed behind a fence. Lee and Longstreet
giving General Hill a sufficiently wide berth, went out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
foot, while Hill rode. In a few moments, says Longstreet,
Hill was making vain and rather ludicrous efforts to dismount
from the third horse killed under him in that engagement,
the legs of the animal having been cut off at the knees by a
cannon ball. When Major Ratchford, who himself was
never known to quail in the face of the foe, but whose affection
for his friend was unbounded, said to him on this occasion:
"General, why do you expose yourself so recklessly?
Do you never feel the sensation of fear?" General Hill
replied that he would never require his men to go where he
did not know the ground or would not go himself, and that
he had no fear of death if he met it in the line of duty. His
friend then inquired if he would not rather live than die.
"Oh, yes," said General Hill, "when I think of my wife and
babies I would; but God will take care of them if he allows
anything to happen to me."</p>

<p>When, in November, 1862, Hill's Division was ordered to
take the lead in the march to Fredericksburg to meet Hooker,
a large number of his men had been barefooted since the
return of the army from Maryland, yet he accomplished the
unusual feat of marching two hundred miles in twenty days
without leaving on the way a single straggler. One of the
remarkable features of the battle of December 13th, 1862,
near Fredericksburg, which followed this sudden transfer of
the seat of war, was the fact that D. H. Hill's Division,
Jubal A. Early's and most of John B. Hood's were in the
reserve line. It was evidence of an easy victory that the services
of three such fighting men were not needed in front.</p>

<p>In February, 1863, Hill bade a final adieu to his old division,
when he was ordered to assume command in the State
of North Carolina. Before the campaign opened in the following
spring Hill had made a demonstration against New
Bern, followed by an advance upon Washington in this State,
which would have resulted in the capture of the latter place
but for Lee's order to send a portion of his command to
Virginia.</p>

<p>Later in the spring of 1863, Hill was ordered to remove
his headquarters to Petersburg, and was placed in command of
the department extending from the James to the Cape Fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
When Lee invaded Pennsylvania the citizens of Richmond
and the heads of the various departments became greatly
alarmed for the safety of the place. The officers in charge
of the defenses of the city and of the Peninsula had failed to
inspire confidence in their vigilance, efficiency or capacity.
When the troops of Dix began to move up the Peninsula
from Yorktown and West Point, General Hill was ordered
by the President to transfer all available troops from south
of the James and assume command of the forces gathered
for the defense of the capital city. With the brigades of
Cooke and M. W. Ransom, and a few other regiments, General
Hill met the army of Dix near Bottom's Bridge, drove
them back without serious difficulty in the direction of West
Point, and in two or three days restored perfect confidence
on the part of the panic-stricken people of the city.</p>

<p>About the 10th of July, 1863, President Davis called at
General Hill's quarters three miles east of Richmond, and,
after many kind and complimentary comments upon his
conduct as an officer during the preceding year, informed
him that he was appointed a lieutenant-general, and would
be ordered to report forthwith to General Joseph E. Johnston,
near Vicksburg, Mississippi. Orders having been issued accordingly,
on the 13th of July General Hill, with his staff,
set out immediately for his new field. When he reached his
home in Charlotte he was notified that his destination had
been changed, and he would report for duty to General
Braxton Bragg at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General D. H. Hill found the army of Bragg
encamped along the Tennessee River in and around the small
town which has since assumed the proportions of a city.
Colonel Archer Anderson, chief of Hill's staff, in his able
address upon the battle of Chickamauga, says: "The corps of
Hardee had lately gained as a commander a stern and dauntless
soldier from the Army of Northern Virginia in D. H.
Hill, whose vigor, coolness and unconquerable pertinacity in
fight had already stamped him as a leader of heroic temper.
Of the religious school of Stonewall Jackson, his earnest convictions
never chilled his ardor for battle, and in another
age he would have been worthy to charge with Cromwell at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
Dunbar, with the cry, 'Let God arise and let his enemies be
scattered.'"</p>

<p>Hill received from Bragg the warm welcome of a comrade
who had seen his metal tried on the hard-fought fields of
Mexico. Not less cordial was the greeting of his old classmate,
A. P. Stewart, and of the plucky Pat. Cleburne, who
seemed from the first to feel that he had found a soldier-affinity
in the congenial spirit of Hill. When at last the
scattered hosts had concentrated and confronted each other
on the Chickamauga, it was not till after the night of the first
day that Bragg made public his purpose to give the entire
management of the right wing to Polk and the control of the
left to Longstreet. If the enemy's left, under the stalwart
Thomas, could be driven from the Lafayette road the communication
with Chattanooga would be cut off and the retreat
and ruin of the enemy inevitable. To accomplish this end
Bragg seemed more intent on hurried than concentrated
effort. That grand man, officer and statesman, John C.
Breckinridge, at his own request was allowed to take the extreme
right, flanked by Forrest and supported in this forward
movement by Cleburne on the left. Stewart having been
transferred to Buckner, these two divisions constituted Hill's
Corps. In rear of the line from which Breckinridge and
Cleburne moved to the attack at nine in the morning, on the
last decisive day, was the corps of the old veteran known as
"Fighting Bill" Walker, and as eager for the fray as a
school-boy for frolic. His command was composed of his own
and Liddell's Divisions, embracing six brigades, led by such
dashing soldiers as Ector, Gist, and Walthall. But the first
lesson learned by a staff officer, who went from the East to
the West, was that even an old war-horse like Walker dared
not to fire a gun or move an inch, acting upon his own best
judgment, without an order brought with due formality
through all of the regular channels. The Virginia Brigadier
struck his blows where opportunity offered and reported to
his superior that he was striking. The Western Brigadier lost
his opportunity to strike waiting for permission to do so.
Still behind Walker stood Frank Cheatham, with his splendid
division, like their leader, chafing under restraint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the dispositions in Hill's rear when the impetuous
charge of Breckinridge's two right brigades broke the
left of Thomas and crossed the fateful road. With two thousand
infantry and a battery of artillery, Breckinridge swung
his line around at a right angle to that of the enemy and
started to sweep down upon their flank; but the left of Breckinridge
had encountered an earthwork, as had Cleburne's
whole line, and their western foe standing firm, one or two
brigades gave way. Another advancing line to fill the gap,
and the day would be won before noon, and the enemy driven
across the Tennessee or captured before night. In vain
might Hill plead or Walker swear, when no orders came and
no chief could be found to give them. Chafed and disappointed,
the grand Kentuckian found himself for want of
support at last exposed to destruction or capture, and slowly
and stubbornly both he and Cleburne fell back and reformed,
but much nearer to the enemy than the line from which they
advanced. Scarcely had the decimated forces of Hill reformed
when, all too late, Walker went forward with another
single line, to be hurled back by the fresh troops that the
enemy was rapidly massing on his left to meet the design
now developed by our ill-managed movement. Cheatham,
meanwhile, was not allowed to budge an inch or fire a gun.
Thus was the plan frustrated and the attacking force driven
back and cut to pieces in detail for want of a present, active,
moving head to strike with the two arms of the right wing at
one time. The fierce onslaught of Hill failed, as did the
no less impetuous charge of Walker, because as a chain is no
stronger than its most defective link, so a single advancing
line is no stouter than its weakest point.</p>

<p>The splendid conduct of our troops on our right and the
dread inspired by Breckinridge's bold charge of the morning
bore fruit, however, in a way entirely unexpected, when
it led the enemy to mass so much of his force behind Thomas.
This was the occupation of the enemy while Hill and Forrest
were riding up and down in front of our line and drawing
the fire of the enemy upon the young troop who followed at
their heels, and when there was a temporary lull in front of
Longstreet on the left and left center.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the thunder of artillery and the roar of musketry
again burst upon us from along the whole front of the Virginia
lieutenant, while Hill in vain sent messenger after
messenger to beg that these lines be formed and a general
advance ordered on the right as well as on the left. Just
before night General Polk permitted Hill to take charge of
the forward movement of the three lines, Walker in front,
his own corps composing the second and Cheatham the third.
The advance of our attacking column on the left, before that
time steady, now became impetuous, and with a momentary
wavering of a brigade on the right, we rushed over the
breastworks of Thomas and caught 5,000 prisoners in the
angle, where Longstreet and Hill met, as they had on many
hard-fought fields before, to discuss the events of that day
and prepare, as they had hoped, for a still more eventful one
that was to follow. But a short time had elapsed when they
were joined by Forrest, impatient for orders to pursue the
flying foe. When some hours had been passed in the vain
effort to learn where the headquarters of the commanding
general were located, Longstreet and Hill agreed to divide
the responsibility of ordering the immediate pursuit by Forrest,
with an assurance that they would ask the privilege of
pushing forward to his support at early dawn.</p>

<p>Unable by the most diligent inquiry to open communication
with Bragg till the next afternoon, they failed to secure
for Forrest the infantry support that would have swept the
single division of Thomas out of the gap on Missionary
Ridge, or flanked and captured it, without another obstruction
in the road to Chattanooga and on to Nashville. Such
might have been the fruits of our victory, which being lost
by delay, the last hope of the tottering Confederacy to regain
the prestige and restore the confidence lost at Gettysburg and
Vicksburg was gone forever.</p>

<p>Scattered along the face of Missionary Ridge, waiting for
the enemy to make Chattanooga impregnable, and then uniting
the forces of Grant and Sherman with the reorganized
army of Thomas to overwhelm them, were the disheartened
Confederates, daily growing weaker from the desertion of
men whose homes were exposed to devastation by the Federals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Buckner drew up and Polk,
Longstreet, Hill, Buckner, Cleburne, Cheatham, Brown, and
other generals signed and sent to the president a petition
stating that the commanding general had lost the confidence
of the army, and asking that he be transferred to another
command and replaced by a more acceptable leader. Hill
was the last of the lieutenant-generals consulted, but, unfortunately
for his future, his headquarters were located at a
central point on the line and the paper was left there to be
signed. Cheatham and Cleburne met at that point and put
their names to the paper at the same time. After the battle
at Murfreesboro, Bragg had addressed letters to the chiefs of
divisions in his army, asking whether he retained the confidence
of the troops, and intimating a willingness to resign
if he had lost it. Breckinridge, Cleburne, and one or two
others promptly answered that they thought he could no
longer be useful in the position he occupied. The correspondence
led to an open breach between Bragg and Breckinridge,
and a newspaper controversy, in which each charged
upon the other the responsibility of our failure at Murfreesboro.
General Breckinridge, in a conversation with me,
stated that his reason for declining to sign the paper was that
his opinion of the commanding general was known, and, as
their relations were already unfriendly, his motives might be
misconstrued.</p>

<p>No better illustration of the prevailing opinion among the
higher officers, as well as the rank and file of the army, in
reference to the efficiency of the commanding general can
be given than the substance of a conversation between Cheatham
and Cleburne, as they joined in a social glass after signing
the petition: "Here are my congratulations upon your
recovery from your bad cold," said Cleburne. "I have had
no bad cold," said Cheatham. "Let me tell you an old
fable," replied Cleburne. "The report had been circulated
among the beasts of the forest that the lion had a bad breath;
whereupon, as king, the lion summoned all to appear, and
admitted them to his presence one by one. As each would
answer, upon smelling his breath, that it was bad, the lion
would devour him. When at length the fox was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
in, he replied to the question that he had a bad cold, and
escaped. You had a bad cold when you wrote Bragg after
the battle of Murfreesboro that you didn't know whether he
still retained the confidence of the army. You have at last
recovered."</p>

<p>Hill cherished no unkind feeling toward Bragg, and at
the time reluctantly reached the conclusion that it was his
duty to join his comrades in urging his removal, hoping that
it might still be within the range of possibility to find a
leader like Jackson, who could overcome superior numbers
by vigilance, celerity, and strategy.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis was induced to believe that Hill was the originator
and most active promoter of the plan to get rid of
Bragg as a chief, and both the President and General Bragg
determined to visit the whole sin of the insubordination of
the inferior officers of that army on him. His name was not
sent to the Senate for confirmation as lieutenant-general,
and the repeated efforts of Johnston, backed by many of his
subordinates, to have Hill returned to the command of a
corps, were refused up to the last campaign of Johnston in
North Carolina. In response to repeated demands made
upon Bragg and the Adjutant for a court of inquiry to report
upon any charge or criticism that the latter might make, Hill
at last received the answer that there were no charges to be
investigated.</p>

<p>But it is due to the memory of General Hill that the world
should know how thoroughly he retained the confidence,
respect and admiration of the officers and men of the army,
which Bragg left after the next fight, never to rejoin till he
found Hill on the soil of his own State leading its reduced
regiments in their last forlorn charge against their old foe.</p>

<p>The following letters, for which he did not ask, but which
he treasured as testimonials of his relations to his troops to
the day of his death, are submitted for the first time for the
vindication of his memory against the suspicion of negligence,
inefficiency, incompetency or infidelity to his trust as
commander of a corps:</p>

It has the merit of at least being disinterested. I saw

<p>I have been in the military service since the 6th of February,
1861, and I have never been under a commander to whom I and
my command formed so strong an attachment in so short a space
of time. In the camp we were not afraid to approach you, and on
the field <em>you</em> were not afraid to approach us and even go beyond
us. This feeling was universal among privates as well as officers
and to a greater degree than I have ever known towards any one
except, perhaps, General Stuart. Those who have been in the military
service and been <em>frozen to death</em> by a different class of officers,
alone know how fully to appreciate this.</p>

your being taken away from us; and in being so taken away our
confidence in you as a soldier, gentleman, and patriot has not been

</p></blockquote>

<p>Long after the war General J. E. Johnston addressed the
following letter to General Hill, from which it will appear
that the influence of Bragg, who was at the elbow of the
President as his military adviser, was still omnipotent after
he was transferred from the west to Richmond:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, D. C., September 22, 1887.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General D. H. Hill</span>:
</p>

<p><i>Dear General</i>:&mdash;Your conduct at Yorktown and at Seven Pines
gave me an opinion (of you) which made me wish for your assistance
in every subsequent command that I had during the war.
When commanding the army of Tennessee, I applied for your assignment
to a vacancy * * * * * * * *</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours very truly,<br />

J. E. JOHNSTON.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is but just to President Davis, as well as to General Hill,
to state that there was good reason to believe that the former,
in his last days, became convinced that General Hill was
not the author of the petition, or the principal promoter of
the plan for Bragg's removal, and that it dawned upon the
great chieftain that the retention of Bragg was the one mistake
of his own marvelous administration of the government
of the Confederacy. When Johnston and others criticised
the President, General Hill, then editing a magazine
that was read by every Confederate, indignantly refused to
utter one reproachful word, even in his own vindication,
because, as he said, the time-servers who had turned their
backs on the Lost Cause were making him the scapegoat to
bear the supposed sin of a nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span></p>

<p>Misjudged, deprived of command and made to stand inactive
in the midst of the stirring scenes of the last days of the
Confederacy, Hill was not a man to sulk in his tent. Volunteering
successively on the staff of his old friends, Beauregard
and Hoke, who appreciated his advice and assistance,
he showed himself ever ready to serve the cause in any
capacity.</p>

<p>The repeated and urgent requests of both Johnston and
Beauregard that Hill should be restored to command, resulted
at last in his assignment to duty at Charleston, from which
place he fell back with our forces to Augusta.</p>

<p>When the remnant of the grand army of Tennessee reached
Augusta in charge of General Stevenson, Johnston ordered
Hill to assume command and move in front of the vast and
victorious hosts of Sherman. The greeting given him by the
little bands of the old legions of Cleburne and Breckinridge
now left was a fitting tribute to an old commander whom
they loved and admired. Hoping against hope, Hill was the
leader above all others to infuse new spirit into the forlorn
band devoted to this desperate duty. At every stream and
on every eminence in his native State he disputed the ground
with Sherman's vanguard till he developed a force that made
it madness to contend further. Hill's reputation as a soldier
depends in nowise upon successful running. This final
retreat was the first and last in which he took a leading part.
When once more his foot was planted upon the soil of North
Carolina it was eminently fitting that he who heard the first
victorious shouts of her first regiment in the first fight in
Virginia would lead her brave sons in the last charge of
the grand army of the great West within her own borders.
Again, as in the last onset of Cox at Appomattox, North
Carolina soldiers stood the highest test of the hero by facing
danger in a gallant charge when they knew that all hope of
success was gone forever.</p>

<p>The last years of General Hill's life were devoted to journalism
and to teaching. As the editor of <cite>The Land We Love</cite>,
and subsequently of <cite>The Southern Home</cite>, he wielded a trenchant
pen and was a potent factor in putting down the <em>post-bellum</em>
statesmen who proposed to relegate to the shades of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
private life the heroes and leaders of the Lost Cause. As a
teacher, he soon placed himself in touch with his pupils and
won their love and confidence, as he did that of the soldiers
led by him to battle.</p>

<p>His opinions, whether upon political, religious or scientific
subjects, were always the result of thought and study, and
were expressed in terse and clear language. As a Christian,
he constantly recurred to the cardinal doctrines of Christ's
divinity and His complete atonement. He wrote two religious
works which evince at once his grace and force as a
writer, and his unbounded trust in these fundamental truths.
The subject of the one was <i>The Sermon on the Mount</i>; of
the other, <i>The Crucifixion</i>.</p>

<p>Unmoved in the presence of danger, schooled to hide his
emotion at suffering in the critical time of battle, and forced
by a sense of duty to show his bitter scorn for cowardice
and treachery, it was the exclusive privilege of his family,
his staff and his closest friends to fathom the depths of his
true nature. The soldiers who saw him in camp or on the field
could as little conceive of the humble Christian who, in the
long hours of the night, pleaded with his God to spare their
lives and save their souls, as they could of the affectionate
father, the loving husband, the sympathizing friend, and the
bountiful benefactor of the poor and helpless, known only to
the favored few. A writer who in his last days was admitted
to the inner circle of his friends, has so beautifully expressed
his idea of his true character that I cannot do better than
reproduce it as not an overdrawn picture, from the standpoint
of one who served on his staff, had free access to his home
circle, and observed and studied his motives and conduct:</p>

<p>"Fancy a man in whom the grim determination of a veteran
warrior is united to a gentle tenderness of manner which
would not be inappropriate to the most womanly of women; ...
affix a pair of eyes that possess the most indisputably
honest and kindly expression; animate him with a mind
clear, deep, and comprehensive, and imbued with a humor
as rich as it is deep and effective; infuse man and mind with
a soul which in its lofty views compels subordination of the
material to the spiritual, and holds a supreme trust in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
wisdom and goodness of the Almighty&mdash;is zealous in the discharge
of duty, and looks with scorn on all that is mean and
sinful. Add to all these a carriage that is indomitable,
and a love of truth and honor which is sublime, and you
have the earthly embodiment of D. H. Hill."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>General Hill, though born in South Carolina, lived most
of his life in North Carolina, the State of his adoption. In
the early part of the war, if there was any hard fighting to
do, Hill usually bore the brunt of it. He was essentially a
"pounder," was utterly fearless, believed in his cause with
his whole heart, despised traitors, and ridiculed those who
sought high places as bomb-proofs. It was this habit of
thus ridiculing and condemning influential men that occasioned
his quarrel with Jefferson Davis, for many of his victims
sought to undermine the confidence of the Confederate
chief in this grim old soldier. General Joe Johnston knew
him, and knew his worth, and, when he was restored to the
command of the army fighting Sherman, he gave Hill the
prominence which he deserved. Hill's address on the "Old
South," delivered in Baltimore, is one of the best and most
interesting of its kind ever published. Like Julius Cæsar,
he was a good writer as well as a good fighter.</p>

<p class="center">BY D. H. HILL.</p>


<p><i>Comrades of the Society of the Army and Navy of the Confederate
States in the State of Maryland</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:&mdash;Years and years ago, "the time
whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary,"
I was a subaltern artillery officer in the United States Army.
There was great striving with the young lieutenants of that
day to be stationed at Fort McHenry, for they said that everybody
in the world knew that the most beautiful and graceful
ladies in the solar system were in the city near by. I give
this as a reminiscence of the long-ago, and not as a piece of
flattery, or as an endorsement of the astronomical opinions of
the lieutenants of artillery of that prehistoric period.</p>

<p>But to-day, the battle-scarred veterans all over the South
pay a higher and grander tribute than that to the mere beauty
and grace of the ladies of the present generation, when they
tell with tearful eyes and husky voices of the kindness and
sympathy shown them while they were hungry, ragged, sick,
and suffering prisoners of war. In all ages of the world
poetry and song have embalmed the ministrations of mercy of
the beautiful to the brave; but these offices of charity rise into
the sublime, when the gentle ministrants receive scorn, contumely,
and contempt for their gracious deeds to the friendless,
the hated and the despised. May God bless the noble
women of Baltimore forever and forever more.</p>

<p>But there came a time when my people owed a still deeper
debt of gratitude to your generous city. It was the time
of the gentle fanning of spring breezes, of the rustling of
the new-born leaves on the trees, of the wafting of perfumery
from buds and flowers, of the busy humming of freshly-awakened
insect life, of the gladsome singing and love-wooing
of birds. The booming of cannon and the ringing of church
bells told of the rejoicing of twenty-five millions of people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
over a restored Union. There was a gladness everywhere but
in the eleven States scorched and withered by the hot blasts
of war. Lee had surrendered, and sorrow had filled the
hearts of those stern warriors who had battled for four years
with the world in arms. But the grief of surrender had
turned into sullen despair, when they came back in this joyous
springtime to their suffering families to find desolation
and destruction everywhere; blackened ruins marked the sites
of the stately mansions of once lordly planters; the fields,
once white with the world's greatest staple, were now fenceless
and unplowed; "the fig-tree had not blossomed, neither
was there fruit in the vine; the labor of the olive had failed,
and the fields yielded no meat; the flocks had been cut off
from the folds, and there were no herds in the stalls"; the
cities were without business, trade, and commerce; and grass
was growing in the streets of the villages almost deserted of
inhabitants. "The elders had ceased from the gates, the
young men from their music (yea, the best and the bravest
of them filled bloody graves). The joy of their heart had
ceased, and their dances had been turned into mourning.
The crown had fallen from the head of their beautiful Southland,
and the Lord of Hosts had seemed to cover himself with
a thick cloud so that the prayers of widows and orphans could
not pass through."</p>

<p>It was at this time, when our whole people were shrouded
with a pall of gloom and anguish, and absolute starvation
was imminent in many places, that the generous heart of
your city throbbed with one simultaneous pulsation of pity.
Then both sexes, all classes and conditions, friends and foes
alike, forgetting political and sectional differences, vied with
one another in sending relief to the afflicted South.</p>

<p>In the name of my countrymen, thus rescued from despair
and death, I invoke the blessings of Almighty God upon the
heads of their deliverers, whatever be their religious creed or
political faith; whatever be the skies of their nativity or their
opinion of the righteousness or unrighteousness of the Southern
cause.</p>

and brave men; the South of Washington and Jefferson; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
Carroll and Rutledge; of Marshall and Taney; of the Pinckneys
of Maryland and South Carolina (for they were of the
same stock); of Andrew Jackson and Winfield Scott; of
Decatur, Mcdonough, and Tattnall; the generous Old South,
which, rich, prosperous, and peaceful under British domination,
cried "The cause of Boston is the cause of us all," and
had her sons slain and her land desolated in defense of her
Northern sister; the magnanimous Old South, which, without
ships and commerce, hoisted in 1812, in the interest of the
carrying trade, the banner inscribed "<i>Free Trade and
Sailors' Rights</i>"; the chivalrous Old South, crying out in
the person of Randolph Ridgeley, when Charley May was
about trying the novel experiment of a charge of cavalry upon
a battery of Mexican artillery, "Hold on, Charley, till I draw
their fire upon myself." Ah! my countrymen, that Old
South did many unselfish deeds which, in the slang of the
day, "didn't pay." But the world was made purer, nobler,
and better by them, and they should be as ointment poured
forth, fragrant through all the ages.</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus has justly been considered mankind's
greatest benefactor, and surely no one ever did great deeds
under more adverse circumstances. Crowned heads had tantalized
him with hope but to baffle his expectations; jealous
courtiers sneered at him; men of science called him a dreamer
and a madman; his own sailors were insubordinate and mutinous.
Through it all, this wonderful man had borne himself
grandly, never losing heart or hope until success had
crowned his efforts. The fame won by Columbus stimulated
the enterprise of the world for the next three hundred and
fifty years, until all the highways and byways of the ocean
had been thoroughly explored, and all its creeks, bays, and
estuaries had been thoroughly surveyed. Then discoveries
ceased, and it was said that there were no more continents,
no more islands, no more coral reefs, no more sand-bars to be
found in all the wide waste of waters. This lull in discovery
continued until 1868, when an enterprising brother from
somewhere north of Mason and Dixon's line announced to
the startled world that he had discovered a hitherto unknown
region of vast extent, with fertile soil, varied and wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
products, the loveliest scenery and the finest climate on the
globe&mdash;cities, towns, villages, and a vast rural population&mdash;all
speaking the English language, though it was not told
whether they were Christian or heathen. The great navigator
had called his discovery the New World, and other
navigators had called theirs New Caledonia, New Zealand,
New Britain, New Hebrides, New Holland, etc.; this land
navigator, of the year of grace 1868, called his discovery the
"New South." The thing stranger to me than even finding
this hitherto unknown land is that the English-speaking race
discovered there have adopted the name given them, are proud
of it, brag about it, and roll it as a sweet morsel under their
tongues. All other barbarians have resented the name imposed
upon them by their discoverers, and have clung to their
old names, their old ideas, and their old traditions.</p>

<p>It will be my business at this time to speak to you, Veterans
of this Association, of the Old South for which we
fought, and for which so many of our comrades, as dear to us
as our own heart's blood, laid down their precious lives. I
would tell you, young people, of that dear Old South which
has passed away, that you may admire and imitate whatever
was grand and noble in its history and reject whatever was
wrong and defective.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing, of Boston, one of the ablest and fairest of
the many gifted men of the North, said more than forty years
ago, that the great passion of the South was for political
power and the great passion of the North was for wealth. I
quote his words: "The South has abler politicians than the
North, and almost necessarily so, because its opulent class
makes politics the business of life.... In the South, an
unnatural state of things turns men's thoughts to political ascendency,
but in the Free States men think little of it. Prosperity
is the goal for which they toil perseveringly from
morning until night. Even the political partisan among us
(the Northern people) has an eye to property and seeks office
as the best, perhaps the only way, of subsistence."</p>

<p>This was a frank confession from a Northern scholar and
thinker, that Northern politicians sought office with an eye to
property and subsistence, while ambitious Southerners sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
for place and power from love of political supremacy. Now,
the motive of the latter class was not good, but these lovers
of high position did have a restraining influence upon the
lovers of money. The scandals that have brought shame
upon the American name occurred when the Old South was
out of power. Who has not heard of the Credit Mobilier
swindle, in which high government officers, Senators and
Representatives, were implicated? Then there were frauds
known as Emma Mine stock, Seneca Stone contract, Whiskey
Ring swindles, Pacific Mail subsidies, sales of Sutlers' Posts,
steals of Government lands, "back salary" grabs, Star Route
robberies, etc., etc. When Southern statesmen had a controlling
influence these knaveries were unknown, because
they were impossible. No official from the Old South,
whether in Cabinet, Congress, Foreign Mission or public position
of any kind, was ever charged with roguery. No great
statesman of that period ever corruptly made money out of
his office. Calhoun, Clay, and Webster were comparatively
poor. Some of our greatest Presidents were almost paupers,
notably Jefferson, Monroe, and Harrison.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing gave the distinction between the North and
the South with great candor and fairness. But we might
still inquire: Why did the North seek property, and why did
the South seek political supremacy, as the chief good? The
reason of the differences between the two sections seems to me
perfectly plain. It was not a race difference between the
two peoples, for they were of the same blood and the same
speech. The ambition of each section as to the avenues in
which it should seek its own self-aggrandizement was determined
by its surroundings. The Northern States of the old
thirteen had magnificent bays and harbors, but a bleak, inhospitable
climate, in which African slaves could not thrive,
and a soil not adapted to producing the things which the world
specially needed. The people of that region then freed or
sold into the South the negroes whom they had brought from
Africa and whom they found to be unprofitable slaves in
their latitude. Naturally, these Northerners turned away
from unremunerative agriculture to the wealth-giving sea and
became the boldest and hardiest navigators the world had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
ever seen; but with all their courage, pluck, and energy they
were averse to war and personal conflicts as interfering with
the peaceful gains of trade. They were too busy to be turbulent.
They put thousands of ships upon the ocean as fishing-smacks,
whalers, and merchantmen. Their shipping interest
called for great centers of trade and for foundries and
machine-shops. They built great cities and huge dock-yards;
they opened vast mines and established rich factories. They
became a money-getting people from the situation in which
their surroundings had placed them. Anglo-Saxon energy
and indomitable will had made them masters of whatever
was at first unfavorable in their situation.</p>

<p>The South had but few ports, and these were in unhealthy
places; it had a climate well suited to the African, and a soil
well adapted to produce those things which the world most
needed. Hence the people of the Old South maintained slavery
and devoted themselves almost exclusively to agriculture.
They built no great cities, for they had no trade; they developed
no mines and erected no factories, for their laborers were
better at field work than at anything else. The Southern men
of property went to the country and became feudal lords of
black retainers, the best fed, the best clothed, the gayest, happiest,
healthiest, strongest serfs the world had ever seen. The
towns and villages at the South were shackly, mostly with unpaved
and unlighted streets. The rural mansions were spacious
and comfortable, seldom grand or elegant. An agricultural
people are seldom rich and the profuse hospitality
of the Southern planter kept him generally straitened in his
means. The Old South labored under a more serious disadvantage;
there were few literary and scientific men among
them. History shows that the great men of the world have
been born chiefly in the country, and that they gained distinction,
not there, but in cities and towns. The fire may be
hid in a flint for countless ages, and the spark only be given
out when the flint is struck by the steel. So the intellectual
giants reared in the free, fresh air of the country have only
given out their grand thoughts under the influence of other
minds in populous places.</p>

<p>Thus, the men of the Old South, being cut off from wealth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
from mining, manufacture, commerce, art, science, and literature,
found but two fields open in which they could distinguish
themselves&mdash;war and politics&mdash;and into these they entered
boldly and successfully and became leading statesmen
and renowned warriors. So the surroundings of the Old
South determined the destiny of its sons, just as the surroundings
of the North determined that of its sons. Exceptional
cases occurred at the South where fame was won outside of
politics. Thus, Audubon, of Louisiana, was the first as he is
the most distinguished, of American ornithologists. Washington
Allston, of South Carolina, ranks among the foremost
of American painters. M. F. Maury, of Virginia, has done
more for navigation than any one of this century, and he
received more medals, diplomas, and honors as a man of
science from European nations than any other American.
John Gill, of New Bern, N. C., is the true inventor of the
revolver which has revolutionized the tactics of the world.
Dr. Clemens, of Salisbury, N. C., is the true inventor of the
telegraph, which has made almost instantaneous the intercourse
between the most distant nations of the earth. McCormick,
of Virginia, was the first to put the reaper into the field,
which has done so much to develop the vast grain fields of
the West. Stevens, of South Carolina, was the first to use
iron as a protection against artillery, and thus the whole system
of naval warfare has been changed. Dr. Reed, of Tuscaloosa,
Ala., is the inventor of rifled cannon, which have
made useless fortifications of stone and brick. Richard Jordan
Gatling, of Hertford county, N. C., is the inventor of
the terrible gun that bears his name. The Georgians claim
that their countryman, Rev. F. R. Goulding, is the inventor
of the sewing machine. General Gabriel J. Rains, by the
construction of a peculiar friction primer, made the use of
torpedoes successful in the Southern waters during the civil
war, and demonstrated that weak maritime nations could be
protected against the most powerful. The Le Contes, of
Georgia, are to-day among our foremost men of science. Dr.
J. Marion Sims, of South Carolina, had more reputation
abroad than any other American physician. In literature,
we have had such men as Marshall, Kennedy, Gayarre, Wirt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
Gilmore Simms, Hawks, Legaré, Hayne, Ryan, Timrod, the
Elliotts, of South Carolina, Ticknor, Lanier, Thornwell, Archibald
Alexander and his sons, Addison and James W., A. T.
Bledsoe, Mrs. Welby, Mrs. Terhune. Brooke, of Virginia,
solved the problem of deep-sea sounding, which had so long
baffled men of science. But the other day, General John
Newton, of Virginia, was at the head of the Engineering
Department of the United States. Stephen V. Benet, of
Florida, is now head of the United States Ordnance Department,
and Dr. Robert Murray, of Maryland, is Surgeon-General.</p>

<p>Most of the Southern inventions were lost to those whose
genius devised them, because the Old South had no foundries
and machine-shops in which they could be made, and no
great centers of trade by which they could be put upon the
market. With rare magnanimity, Southern Congressmen
had voted for protective tariffs, fishing bounties and coast-trade
regulations, which did so much to build up the big
cities and great commerce of the North and to fill its coffers
to overflowing. Even Mr. Calhoun had voted to protect "infant
industries," believing that the infants would in the
course of time learn to crawl and walk, and do without pap.
But that time has not yet come. Thomas Prentice Kettell,
a Northern man, estimates that in these three ways the Old
South contributed from 1789 to 1861 $2,770,000,000 of her
wealth to Northern profits. Our statesmen knew, surely,
that their own section would never get one dollar in return
from this enormous expenditure. But they were patriotic
enough to be willing to make the nation rich and prosperous,
even at the expense, for a season, of their own beloved South.
My Countrymen! that Old South was a generous Old South.
The world scoffs at such generosity and says, "it don't pay."
The Old South believed with the wise man that "A good
name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and loving
favor than gold and silver." But the world does not think
with Solomon and the Old South, and chooses great riches
rather than the good name, and gives its loving favor to the
holders of the gold and silver. But while the Old South had
some success in literature, art, and science, the character of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
people ought to be judged mainly by what they accomplished
in two departments to which their efforts were mostly restricted&mdash;politics
and war. Did the Old South give to the
country wise statesmen and brave warriors? This will be the
subject of the present investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft says: "American Independence, like the
great rivers of the country, had many sources, but the head-spring
which colored all the stream was the Navigation Act."
The whole of New England was in a blaze of fury because
of it. The effect of it upon their commerce and shipping
interest was most disastrous, and they believed that ruin impended
over them. The Old South was equally excited,
though it had no carrying trade and was in nowise affected
by the act. But an agricultural people, living much by
themselves, develop large individuality, and are always liberty-loving.
Hence, though in many respects the gainers by intercourse
with England, the sons of the Old South stoutly
resisted all encroachments upon their freedom by the Mother
Country&mdash;a term of endearment they still loved to use. The
Old South denounced the Navigation Act, which did not hurt
its interests at all, just as severely as it did the Stamp and
Revenue Acts. All were blows at the inalienable rights of
freemen, and all were alike opposed. Christopher Gadsden,
of South Carolina, in a speech delivered in Charleston in
1766, advocated the independence of the colonies, and he
was the first American to proclaim that thought. The first
American Congress met in Philadelphia on the 7th of October,
1774. Peyton Randolph, of Virginia, was elected President
of that body. On the 20th of May, 1775, the Scotch-Irish
of Mecklenburg county, N. C., absolved all allegiance
to the crown of Great Britain, and set up a government of
its own. On the 12th of April, 1776, the Provincial Congress
of North Carolina took the lead of all the States in
passing resolutions of independence. On the 7th of June
that year, Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, moved: "These
United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
States." It was upon this motion in the Continental
Congress that the separation from Great Britain took place.
It was a Virginian who wrote the Declaration of Independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
It was a Virginian who led the rebel armies to victory
and to freedom. It was a Southerner, Charles Pinckney,
of South Carolina, whose draft of the Constitution was mainly
adopted.</p>

<p>Thus, independence was declared upon the motion of one
Southerner; its principles were set forth in the declaration
written by another Southerner. A third led the armies of
the rebel colonies to victory, while a fourth framed the Constitution,
which, though denounced at one time by the South-haters
as "a covenant with death and a league with hell,"
has lived for a hundred years, and is likely to live for many
hundreds more.</p>

<p>You of this newly-discovered region need not be ashamed
of your ancestors and blush that they lived in the Old Bourbon
South. That Bourbon régime lasted for eighty years,
the grandest and noblest of American history. Eleven of
seventeen Presidents were of Southern birth. Fifty-seven of
the eighty were spent under the administration of Southern-born
Presidents. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,
and Jackson, each served eight years, in all forty years&mdash;just
one-half the life of the nation. Of the six Northern Presidents,
John Quincy Adams was elected by the House of
Representatives and not by the people and contrary to the
wishes of the people. Nor was Mr. Fillmore elected to the
Presidency, but on the death of General Taylor succeeded to
the office and served out the unexpired term. So during the
existence of the Old South, John Adams, Van Buren, Pierce,
and Buchanan were the only Northern Presidents elected by
the people. A remarkable thing is, that all the Southern
Presidents were re-elected by the people except Mr. Polk,
and he did not seek a renomination. This fact speaks volumes
for the capacity of Southern men for the administration
of affairs. Another curious fact is that every Northern President
had associated with him as Vice-President a man from
the Old South. Thus, the first Adams had Jefferson, the
second Adams had Calhoun, Van Buren had R. M. Johnson,
Pierce had W. R. King, and Buchanan had Breckinridge.
On the other hand Jackson served one term as President with
a Southern man, Calhoun, as Vice-President; Harrison and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
his associate were both born in Virginia; Lincoln and Johnson
were both born in the South.</p>

<p>This period of eighty years has been called by the North:
"The Era of the Domination of the Slave-power." Without
raising an objection to the discourteous phraseology, I would
simply say that it is an admission that the South had marvelous
success in its desire for political supremacy&mdash;one of the
two objects of its ambition. Before passing to our second
question: "Did the Old South produce brave and successful
warriors?" I will allude to a few characteristic incidents,
which do not bear materially upon either of the two questions
under consideration.</p>

<p>"In the year 1765, on the passage of the Stamp Act, Colonel
John Ashe, Speaker of the House of Commons of North
Carolina, informed Governor Tryon that the law would be
resisted to every extent. On the arrival of the British sloop-of-war
<i>Diligence</i> in the Cape Fear river he and Colonel
Waddell, at the head of a body of the citizens of New Hanover
and Brunswick counties marched down together, and
frightened the captain of the sloop so that he did not attempt
to land the stamped paper. Then they seized the boat of the
sloop, and carried it with flags flying to Wilmington, and the
whole town was illuminated that night. On the next day
they marched to the Governor's house and demanded that
Tryon should desist from all attempts to execute the Stamp
Act, and forced him to deliver up Houston, the stampmaster
for North Carolina. Having seized upon him, they carried
him to the market-house, and there made him take an oath
never to attempt to execute the duties of his office as stampmaster.</p>

<p>"It was nearly ten years after that the Boston tea-party
assembled, when a number of citizens, disguised as Indians,
went on board a ship and threw overboard the tea imported
in her. This was done in the night by men in disguise, and
was directed against a defenseless ship. But the North Carolina
movement, ten years earlier in point of time, occurred in
open day, and was made against the Governor himself, ensconced
in his palace, and by men who scorned disguise."&mdash;<i>Senator
T. L. Clingman.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span></p>

<p>Every schoolboy knows of the Boston tea-party of 1773;
how many of my intelligent audience know of the Wilmington
party of 1765? Yea, verily, the Old South has sorely
needed historians of its own.</p>

<p>Virginia gave seven Presidents and many illustrious statesmen
and warriors to the nation. She gave Patrick Henry,
the war-trumpet of the Revolution, Washington, its sword,
and Jefferson, its mouth-piece. When independence and
white-winged peace came to the colonies, she gave to the
Union that vast Northwest Territory, out of which have been
carved the great States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan,
and Wisconsin. [New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut
also ceded their claim to this territory.]</p>

<p>Oh, but generosity does not pay. Possibly the "mother
of States and statesmen" thought so when the soldiers of
these five great States swarmed over her soil, and grand old
Virginia became District No. 1.</p>

<p>I'll now take up the second question: "Did the Old South
furnish brave soldiers?" The commander-in-chief in the rebellion
against Great Britain was the Southern-born Washington,
of whom Byron lamented that the earth had no more
seed to produce another like unto him, and of whom Wellington
said "He was the grandest, the sublimest, and yet withal
the plainest and simplest character in the world's history."
That the Old South did its duty in this war, I will try to
show, notwithstanding imperfect records and deceptive pension
rolls. The Old South went nobly to the assistance of
their Northern brethren, who were first attacked, and nearly
all the battle-fields of the North were drenched with Southern
blood. In the retreat from Long Island, Smallwood's
Maryland regiment distinguished itself above all the continental
troops, losing two hundred and fifty-nine in killed and
wounded. The Virginians made up a large portion of the
army of Washington at Trenton and Princeton, where the
wails of despair of the American people were changed into
shouts of victory. Two future Presidents of the United
States of Southern birth were in those battles, one of whom
was wounded. The only general officer there slain was in
command of Virginia troops. Southern blood flowed freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
at Brandywine and Germantown, and in the latter battle a
North Carolina general was slain, whose troops suffered
greatly. It was General George Rogers Clark, of Virginia,
who, with a Virginia brigade, chastised the Indians that committed
the massacre in the valley of Wyoming. He made a
Stonewall Jackson march to the rear, penetrated to the upper
Mississippi, captured the Governor of Detroit, and took large
booty in his raid. At Monmouth and Saratoga, Southern
blood was commingled with the Northern in the battles of
freedom. In the battle of Saratoga, Morgan's Virginia
Riflemen greatly distinguished themselves and slew General
Fraser, the inspiring spirit of the British army. The guerilla
troops, under Sumter, Marion, Moultrie, Pickens, Clarke,
and others, drove the British, step by step, back to Charleston,
where they were cooped up till the end came.</p>

<p>It is my deliberate opinion that no battles of the Revolution
will compare in brilliancy with the defense of Moultrie,
the defeat of Ferguson at King's Mountain, and the defeat
of Tarleton at Cowpens, all fought by Southern troops on
Southern soil. In the last fight the victory was won when
almost lost by the cavalry charge of William Washington,
and the free use of the bayonet by that peerless soldier, your
own John Eager Howard. The old "tar-heel" State, on the
16th of May, 1771, in the Battle of Alamance, poured out
the first blood of the Revolution in resistance to British
tyranny. The battle of Guilford Court House, fought on
her soil solely by Southern troops, gave Cornwallis his first
check in his career of victory, and led eventually to his capture.
The first victory of the Revolution was won at Moore's
Creek Bridge, in North Carolina, by Caswell and Lillington,
in which one thousand Scotch loyalists were captured. Who
knows of that battle? Oh, modest tar-heel State, in the
slang of the newly-discovered country, "modesty does not
pay!" Nevertheless, true courage and true modesty walk
hand in hand. One word as to the misleading rolls of the
Revolution. I was born in the Scotch-Irish settlement of
Carolina, which furnished troops to Sumter, Pickens, Davie,
Davidson, Shelby, and others. These men were never regularly
enrolled; they gathered together for battle, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
back to their plows when the fight was over. There were no
Tories in that regiment; it was thoroughly Whig. But I
never heard of more than one pensioner in all that country.
These men scorned the bounty of the Government for simply
doing their duty. No official records ever bore the names of
those gallant partisans, whose daring deeds are known only to
the Omniscient. There were no horn-blowers and quill-drivers
among them.</p>

<p>If we come to the war of 1812, all will concede that Jackson,
of North Carolina, and Harrison, of Virginia, gained the
most laurels, as shown by the elevation of both of them to
the Presidency. All, too, readily concede that the brilliant
land fights of that war were in defense of New Orleans, Mobile,
Craney Island, and Baltimore, all fought by Southern
troops on Southern soil.</p>

<p>Although the war was waged in the interest of the maritime
rights of the North, it soon became unpopular in New
England, because it seriously damaged trade and commerce.
The Hartford Convention shows how deep was the defection
in that region. The doctrine of secession was taught there
half a century before the South took it up.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Hence, in this
war, the Old South furnished more than her proportion of
troops. Southern troops flocked North, and in the battles in
Canada a large number of general officers were from the
Old South; Harrison, Scott, Wilkinson, Izard, Winder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
Hampton, Gaines, Towson, Brooke, Drayton, and others.
Kentucky sent more men for the invasion of Canada than did
any other State.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In Barnes' <cite>History of the United States</cite> the author tells us
(page 167) of the ravaging of the Southern coast in the war of
1812 by the noted Admiral Cockburn. He says: "Along the Virginia
and Carolina coast, he (Cockburn) burned bridges, farm-houses,
and villages; robbed the inhabitants of their crops, stock, and
slaves; plundered churches of their communion services and murdered
the sick in their beds." And then the author explains why
the Southern coast was devastated and the New England coast
was not disturbed. This explanation is in a foot-note, which reads
as follows: "New England was spared because of a belief that
the Northern States were unfriendly to the war and would yet
return to their allegiance to Great Britain."
</p>
<p>
This is the statement of a Northern writer, and not the fabrication
of an enemy. How did the belief start among the British
people that New England wished to return to its allegiance to the
"mother country?"</p></div>

<p>All honor to the United States sailors of the North who had
no sympathy with the Hartford Convention, and nobly did
their duty&mdash;Perry, Bainbridge, Stewart, Lawrence, Porter,
Preble, and others. The "Don't give up the ship" of the
dying Lawrence is a precious legacy to the whole American
people.</p>

<p>But the unmaritime South claims among the naval heroes
of that period Decatur, of Maryland; Macdonough, of Delaware;
Jacob Jones, of same State; the two Shubricks of South
Carolina; Jesse D. Elliott, of Maryland; Blakely, of North
Carolina, and others. A very large proportion of the naval
heroes of the war of 1812 came from Maryland.</p>

<p>In the Mexican war the commanders-in-chief on both
lines were born in Virginia, one of whom became President
for his exploits, and the other an unsuccessful candidate for
the Presidency. This war was unpopular in the North, and
hence the South furnished troops to carry it on out of all
proportion to her population. The Old South, out of a total
population of 9,521,437, gave 48,649 volunteers, and gave
also the rifle regiment, recruited within her borders, making
in all 50,000 soldiers. The North, out of a population of
13,676,439, gave but 24,698 volunteers. All New England
gave 1,057 volunteers. (I use the American Almanac for
these figures and the census report of 1850.)</p>

<p>It will be admitted, without question, that Butler's South
Carolina and Davis' Mississippi gained more reputation than
the other volunteer regiments. I think it will be equally admitted
that Quitman's Southern division of volunteers had the
confidence of General Scott, next to his two divisions of regulars.
Scott's chief engineers on that wonderful march from
Vera Cruz to the City of Mexico were Swift, of North Carolina,
and R. E. Lee, of Virginia. His chief of ordnance was
Huger, of South Carolina.</p>

<p>The most brilliant exploit of that war was the attack of
Tattnall, of Georgia, in a little gunboat, upon the castle of
San Juan D'Ulloa and the land batteries at Vera Cruz. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
there was anything more daring in that war, so full of great
deeds, my eyes were not so fortunate as to behold it.</p>

<p>The bold, bluff tar of that day had a gentle, loving heart,
full of kindly sympathy with his own race and lineage, as
shown by rowing through shot and shell to offer such assistance
as international law permitted to the British Admiral
suffering under the murderous fire of the Peiho forts in China.
"Blood is thicker than water" was the grand sentiment of
the grand sailor, as he hurried to the rescue of the sufferers
of his own blood and race. These things don't pay; nevertheless,
it would be a cold, miserable, selfish world without
them.</p>

<p>Maryland had no reason to suppose that her sons had degenerated
from the days of Otho Williams, John Eager Howard,
and William Smallwood when the Mexican war brought
out such men as Ringgold, the first organizer of horse-artillery;
Ridgeley, his dashing successor; and Charley May, the hero
of the cavalry charge upon the Mexican battery.</p>

<p>Coming down to the Civil War, the President on the Union
side was a Southern-born man, his successor was born in
North Carolina, and the commanding general, who first organized
his troops, was a Virginian. His great War Secretary,
the Carnot of that day, was born in Edgecombe county,
North Carolina, though he would never admit it.</p>

<p>The Union generals who struck us the heaviest blows, next
to those of Grant and Sherman, were from our own soil.
From West Point there came forth forty-five graduates of
Southern birth, who became Federal generals. I have their
names, from George H. Thomas and George Sykes to David
Hunter and John Pope, with the States of their nativity, viz.:
George H. Thomas, Va.; George Sykes, Del.; E. O. C. Ord,
Md.; R. C. Buchanan, Md.; E. R. S. Canby, Ky.; Jesse L.
Reno, Va.; John Newton, Va.; R. W. Johnson, Ky.; J. J.
Reynolds, Ky.; J. M. Brannan, D. C.; John Buford, Ky.;
Thomas J. Wood, Ky.; John W. Davidson, Va.; John C.
Tidball, Va.; Alvan C. Gillenn, Tenn.; William R. Terrill,
Va.; A. T. A. Torbert, Del.; Samuel L. Carroll, D. C.; N. B.
Buford, Ky.; Alfred Pleasonton, D. C.; I. M. Mitchell, Ky.;
George W. Getty, D. C.; William Hayes, Va.; A. B. Dyer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Va.; John J. Abercrombie, Tenn.; Robert Anderson, Ky.;
Robert Williams, Va.; Henry E. Maynadier, Va.; Kenner
Garrard, Ky.; H. C. Bankhead, Md.; H. C. Gibson, Md.;
John C. McFerran, Ky.; B. S. Alexander, Ky.; E. B.
Alexander, Ky.; Washington Seawell, Va.; P. St. G. Cooke,
Va.; G. R. Paul, Mo.; W. H. Emory, Md.; R. H. K. Whitely,
Md.; W. H. French, Md.; H. D. Wallen, Mo.; J. L. Donaldson,
Md.; Fred. T. Dent, Mo.; David Hunter, Va.; John
Pope, Ky. Most of these were good officers, and some of
them were superb. I could name six or eight of them who
did the very best they could for their native land by going on
the Federal side. In addition to these forty-five West Point
Southerners in the Federal army, some of the high officers of
that army were born in the South, but not educated at West
Point; Joseph R. Hawley (now Senator from Connecticut);
John C. Frémont, the three Crittendens, and Frank Blair.</p>

<p>If we come to the United States Navy we find abundant
proof of Southern prowess. Farragut, of Tennessee, was considered
the hardest fighter and most successful commander,
as shown by his elevation to the highest rank, that of Admiral&mdash;a
rank specially created in order to honor him. Winslow,
of North Carolina, was made a Rear-Admiral for sinking
the Alabama. Goldsborough, of Maryland, was made a
Rear-Admiral for the capture of Hatteras. Many other
names of gallant Southerners will readily occur to you who
are more familiar with the United States Navy than I am.</p>

<p>I will refer to but five points more in connection with the
Civil War:</p>

<p><i>Disparity of numbers.</i> The population of the eleven
States that seceded was, in 1860, 8,710,098, of whom 3,520,840
were slaves. That of the other States and Territories
was 22,733,223, giving an excess over the whole seceded population
of 14,023,125, and over the white population, of 17,543,965;
the excess of population being nearly double the
whole population of the States in revolt, and more than three
times the white population of those States. These are tremendous
odds, my countrymen, and the Old South need not
be ashamed of her sons who contended for four years against
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the job of "suppressing the unnatural rebellion"
still dragged its slow length along, 54,137 sympathetic Union
men in the Rebel States joined the Federal army, and 186,017
"brothers in black" were in some way induced to enter
the service. Secretary Stanton assured the world that the
"colored troops fought nobly," and that without them "the
life of the nation could not have been saved." There is another
interesting aspect of the numerical statistics. The seceded
States are supposed to have had, from first to last, seven
hundred thousand men in the field, and you must admit that
this is a very large number out of a population of five millions.
The other belligerent had in the field from the first
to last, 2,859,132, or more than four times the Confederate
forces. Where did these immense hosts come from? The
Southern States on the border, slave-holding States, furnished
in all 301,062, and thus the entire South gave to the Union
army 541,216 fighting men. From what quarter of the
globe did the remaining two million three hundred thousand
come?</p>

<p>Rosengarten, in his book, the <cite>German Soldier</cite>, puts down
the number of Germans in the Federal army at 187,858.
I don't know certainly, but I suppose that the Irish soldiers
were as numerous as the German in the Federal army, for the
Irish seemed to lead every attack and cover every retreat&mdash;Sumner's
Bridge, Marye's Heights, Sharpsburg, Chickamauga&mdash;always
fighting with the indomitable pluck of their
race. I once complimented for their gallantry some Irish
troops in our service, and I modestly claimed that I had Irish
blood in my veins. But as I had broken up some barrels of
whiskey a short time before, they would not own me, and I
heard that they said: "Af the owld hapocrit had one dhrop
of Irish blood in his veins, he would never have smashed
whasky as he did." Then there were in the Federal army
Russians, Austrians, Hungarians, Slavs, Magyars, and Teutons
alike&mdash;Scandinavians, Englishmen, Scotchmen, Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, Canadians, and the inhabitants
of the far off isles of the sea. I think then that it is
true that the seceded States and the border slave-holding
States gave more native-born soldiers to the Union army than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
did the North give of her native-born sons to that army!
Surely, then, General Sherman was mistaken in saying that
the Civil War was a war of races, the South against the North.
This is hardly fair to Farragut and Thomas and their gallant
associates of the army and navy, and the half million of brave
men who fought with them.</p>

<p><i>Disparity of resources.</i> Oh! my brethren of the loyal
North, do not taunt us with our poverty, when your own
writer, Thomas Prentice Kettell, tells the world that the
South gave $2,770,000,000 of her wealth to swell Northern
profits. If that money were given back to us, we could get
up a "big boom" sure enough, and become a veritable New
South. As it was, we were poor in military resources in
1861. We were without mines, without factories, foundries,
machine-shops, rolling-mills&mdash;without mechanical appliances
of every kind. We rushed into war, not only without ships
of war and trade, but without a single mill to make powder
in the whole Confederacy, and without even a single machine
to make percussion caps. We had been dependent upon the
North for everything, even for the paper upon which the
Ordinances of Secession were written, and for the ink and
pens used in the writing. There never was a people on earth
so destitute of all means of making war material and of supplying
comforts and conveniences for those in camps and for
those at home. From first to last, we had to depend
largely upon the spoils taken from the enemy with Stonewall
Jackson as Quartermaster and Commissary-General. From
first to last, ours was the worst fed, worst clothed and worst
equipped army in the world, deficient in medical stores, in
ordnance stores, in wagons, tents, shoes&mdash;even in artillery
and rifles. Theirs was the best organized, the best equipped
and the most pampered army in the world, with abundant
commissariat, medical supplies, transportation, ordnance
stores, etc.</p>

<p>A young rebel lieutenant who had been accustomed at
home to a dram before each meal, and at frequent intervals
between these three periods, was asked when the war would
be over. "I am no military man," groaned he. "I know
nothing of military affairs; but one thing I do know, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
that is that the Confederacy has started the biggest temperance
movement the world ever saw."</p>

<p>You all know how readily the Irish of the two armies affiliated
when they came together as captors and prisoners. At
the second battle of Manassas I was amused at a conversation
between some Federal Irishmen and their countrymen in
my division, who were in charge of them. One of the Irish
prisoners complained to one of my Irishmen that he had not
had anything to eat in twenty-four hours. My man replied:
"And are you after complaining of such a trifle as that?
Why, Pat, me boy, in the Southern Confederacy we have one
male (meal) a week and three fights a day."</p>

<p><i>Confederate Navy.</i> I wished to say a few words in regard
to the Confederate navy, and I regret that I am so ignorant
on this subject. I had the honor to know a few, and a few
only, of our naval heroes, but these were all grand men.
Among them were Semmes, the Chevalier Bayard of the
ocean; J. I. Waddell (of an illustrious North Carolina lineage),
almost the peer of Semmes as a successful cruiser: M.
F. Maury, the greatest benefactor to the merchant and naval
marine the world has ever known; the brave W. F. Lynch,
the Christian scholar and explorer; the gallant Pegram, Hunter,
Alexander. I was proud before the Civil War of the
fame of Tattnall, Ingraham, and Hollins, and was glad that
they cast in their lot with their own people. I always regretted
that I never saw your own Franklin Buchanan, the
hardest fighter on our side, as Farragut, of Tennessee, was on
their side. These two Southerners rose to the highest rank
in their respective navies. But in that of which I know so
little I do not wish, in my ignorance, to make distinctions.
I have introduced the subject merely to express a long-felt
opinion, viz.: that it required a higher and nobler patriotism
for our sailors to leave the navy than for our soldiers to leave
the army, for very obvious reasons: 1st, the flag to the sailor
not only told him in foreign lands of his country, but it spoke
of his far-off home, with all its endearments. It was hard for
him to give up the old flag with all these sacred associations.
2d. Our army officers gave up generally subordinate positions
to command regiments, brigades, divisions, and armies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
naval officers gave up fine positions on great ships of war to
serve in little tubs of vessels, of which they must have been
ashamed. 3d. The true sailor is a sailor and not a land-lubber.
He never gets off his sea-legs on shore. Our patriotic
naval officers knew certainly that the failure of our
cause would drive them from the sea and compel them to
seek business on land, in which they would feel as awkward
as <i>Commodore Trunnion</i> on the fox-hunt. All honor to the
noble men who put country above self and self-interest. The
Old South had thousands of unselfish men, but I put these in
the foremost of them all.</p>

<p><i>Indebtedness of the nation to the Old South.</i> The statesmen
of the Old South were all broad-gauge men. They had
fully the instincts of the Japhetic race for land-grabbing and
they were eager to fulfill the prophecy in regard to the enlargement
of Japhet's borders. We find, accordingly, that
every inch of territory that has been added to the area belonging
to the original thirteen States has been added under
Southern Presidents, and all has been acquired save Alaska,
during the "Era of the domination of the slave-power."
When Jefferson came to the executive chair the whole Union
comprised about 830,789 square miles. By wise policy and
diplomacy, he won, without one drop of blood, for the paltry
sum of fifteen million dollars, that vast territory out
of which have been carved nine great States and six large
Territories, embracing in all 1,282,005, or 415,216 square
miles more than the United States possessed before his administration.
That is, he doubled the area of the United States,
and had this respectable slice left over. Mr. Blaine, in his
recent speech at St. Louis, said in reference to this grand
achievement: "In the annals of American greatness, Jefferson
deserves to be ranked as the second Washington."</p>

<p>Monroe found a troublesome neighbor in Florida, and by
the payment of five million dollars, with a few hangings by
Andrew Jackson thrown in, he made loyal citizens of the
United States out of the Spaniards and mongrel breeds in that
territory, and enlarged the area of the Union by 58,680 square
miles. Next came the annexation of Texas, under Tyler, and
the Mexican war, under Polk, which added to the Union two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
huge States and four huge Territories, and 855,410 square
miles.</p>

<p>These were notoriously Southern measures, advocated by
Southern statemen, and carried out by Southern Presidents,
in spite of the opposition of the South-hating philanthropists.
This policy enlarged our territory 2,196,095 square miles,
nearly treble its area, extended the power of the government
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and gained the richest mineral,
farming, and grazing grounds on the globe. With prophetic
vision, Southern statesmen had seen that our country
must extend to the Pacific, and from its ports carry on a trade
with the populous nations of the East. Think of it, but for
the Old South, a Spanish province would bound the United
States on the South, and the Mississippi river, under the control
of France, would bound it on the west. Compare, ye
English-speaking Americans, the United States which Jefferson
found with the United States which Polk left, and then
you will form some conceptions of the indebtedness of the
nation to the Old South.</p>

<p>Next came the purchase of Alaska, and the gain of 577,000
square miles of territory. By a singular providence, this acquisition
was advocated by the South-hating philanthropists,
and consummated by a Southern President. Southern men
favored it, not that they expected to gain anything thereby,
but the land-grabbing instinct was strong in them, and they
knew that the wives of their neighbors in the loyal North
would need furs and sealskin sacques. Thus we see, that,
under Southern Presidents, the area of the United States has
increased from 830,789 square miles to 3,603,884 square
miles; that is, it is now four times as big as it was. There
is not a man of intelligence in the Union who does not know
that this vast increase has been due to Mr. Jefferson and the
Old South.</p>

<p>Oh! men of the loyal North, in view of what the Old South
has done in quadrupling the national domain, with all of the
inestimable advantages, thereof, let us cry quits and stop talking
about Jeff Davis and the sour-apple tree, and talk rather
of Jefferson, Monroe, Tyler, and Johnson. Probably, too, a
few words might be whispered in commendation of the Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
South for its Japhetic proclivities, for its gift of Washington,
and a long line of statesmen and warriors, and for its donation
out of its poverty, up to this date, of more than three billions
of dollars to swell the wealth of the North.</p>

<p><i>Results of the War.</i> I would place <em>first</em> of these the general
diffusion of love for the Constitution of the United States.
Time was when the then South-hating philanthropists denounced
it as "a covenant with death and league with hell,"
gotten up by the slave-power in the interests of slavery.
But in 1861 the philanthropists experienced a change of
heart, and ever since have talked of the Constitution as that
"sacred instrument," that "bulwark of freedom," that "palladium
of liberty!" I am glad of their conversion, suspiciously
sudden though it was, and I hope that they will never
fall from grace. As a stalwart Presbyterian, I believe in the
perseverance of the saints.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> Change of views in regard to the intellectual,
moral, and social status of the negro. The philanthropists
used to tell of the cruelty and brutality of slave-holders to
their slaves, and said that they had reduced the negroes to
the lowest state of ignorance, barbarism, and bestiality. But
in the reconstruction period the philanthropists underwent
a radical change of views and discovered that these negroes,
whom they had described as more savage and degraded than
the barbarians on the Congo, were not merely enlightened,
and civilized enough to be freemen and voters, but also to be
United States Senators and Congressmen, Foreign Ministers,
Consuls and Marshals, Governors of States, Judges, Members
of State Cabinets, etc. I am glad that the philanthropists
found out that the Old South had trained its slaves so carefully
for these high and responsible duties. No other masters
in the world's history ever gave such training to their
slaves. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
to the Constitution of the United States are the grandest
possible eulogies to the Old South.</p>

<p>But there was one great error in this training. The simple-hearted,
confiding Southern masters, always careless of their
own money, did not teach their slaves to be cautious about
their investments, and tens of thousands of these credulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
creatures put their money in a bank in Washington, established
by the philanthropists, and <em>lost it all</em>.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> The development of great men. I love to hear
the praises of the wonderful deeds of McClellan, Grant,
Meade, and Hancock, for if they were such great warriors for
crushing with their massive columns the thin lines of ragged
Rebels, what must be said of Lee, the two Johnstons, Beauregard,
and Jackson, who held millions at bay for four years
with their fragments of shadowy armies?</p>

<p>Pile up huge pedestals and surmount them with bronze
horses and riders in bronze. All the Union monuments are
eloquent of the prowess of the ragged Rebels and their leaders.
Suppose the tables had been turned, and that either
of the five Southerners named above had been superior to his
antagonists in all the appliances and inventions of war, and
had been given, moreover, an excess of two million of men
over them, how many statues, think ye, my countrymen,
would there be of bronze warriors and prancing chargers?</p>

<p>The Congressmen from the Old South have voted liberally
for all legitimate pension bills to Union Veterans, for they
know what a tough job it was for the 2,859,132 Union soldiers,
with their magnificent outfit, to overcome the seven
hundred thousand Rebels, poorly fed, poorly clothed and
poorly equipped. These pension bills are splendid tributes
to the pluck, patience, perseverance, and fortitude of the chivalry
of the Old South.</p>

<p>I love to hear the philanthropists praise Mr. Lincoln and
call him the second Washington, for I remember that he was
born in Kentucky, and was from first to last, as the <cite>Atlantic
Monthly</cite> truly said, "a Southern man in all his characteristics."
I love to hear them say that George H. Thomas was
the stoutest fighter in the Union army, for I remember that
he was born in Virginia. When the old lady of the Old
South hears the eulogies upon these men she pushes back her
spectacles that she may have a better view of the eulogists,
and says: "These were <em>my</em> children." Then the old lady
adds: "I have another son born in Kentucky, and he is not
a stepson, nor did I raise him to die on a sour-apple tree."</p>
